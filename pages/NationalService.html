                    National Service: The bane of every Singaporean son. 
                    <br><br>
                    Some are neutral about it, few love it and would go on to make it about their whole identity (you could say their lives peaked in NS), but I would
                    say that the majority of guys absolutely hated it.
                    <br><br>
                    I was no exception.
                    <br><br>
                    Back in school, national service was a concept that always seemed distant to me. Don't get me wrong, I knew it was something I had to face
                    when I finished JC, but it just seemed always barely out of reach. Back then, the only exposure I had were the ridiculous stories that 
                    my brother share. He made NS sound like something out of a fiction book, meaningless but yet unending in entertainment.
                    <br><br>
                    Back then, I confess I was affected by the propoganda of our government that is the Ah Boys To Men films. Before we would even enlist, selected individuals
                    would be notified that they are eligible for the prestigious elite units of the army, namely the Naval Diving Unit (NDU) and the Commandos. There were only two
                    extremes to the reactions upon receiving the letters: utter despair and pure elation. I, of course, had hopes of receiving a letter from NDU, because I was thoroughly converted by the Ah Boys
                    To Men: Frogmen film, but alas, the only letter I got was to report to BMTC.
                    <br><br>
                    In hindsight, this was a blessing in disguise.

                    Time has made me forget a lot of things, so rather than writing in chronological order, I would instead write short excerpts of whatever comes to mind.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Mono-intake Incident</strong><br>
                    I enlisted on the 4th of April 2019. I was one of the unfortunates of the JC batch to enlist in April. Having seen almost everyone around me enlist during January, I honestly felt left behind. 
                    <br><br>
                    Before enlistment, my brother would tell me one and only one thing: Just don't get into mono-intake. Now for those
                    unfamiliar with this term, mono intake happens when an individual wins the lottery ticket. Due to supposed manpower issues, randomly selected individuals
                    would have a unit assigned to them prior to their enlistment, meaning that their future in NS has been decided on day one. This is unlike everyone else, whose units
                    are often decided when they pass out from BMT (men)/ graduate from command school (sergeants/officers). 
                    <br><br>
                    So why exactly is mono intake undesirable? Well it's because mono-intake only occurs for combat units such as Singapore Infantry Regiment (SIR), Singapore Armoured
                    Regiment (SAR), Guards and elite units. These units are no fun. Once you are considered mono-intake, you can kiss your ass goodbye to all the good postings such as CMPB, Navy, Air Force, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    But one should not lose hope if they are assigned into mono-intake. CMPB accounts for attrition rates in each intake, there will bound to be people 
                    who will end up downpes-ing and becoming non-combat fit. As such, one actually has a slim chance of getting posted out. So for those 
                    wallowing in self-despair at the news of your mono-intake, keep your chin up king, you might just still have a shot at life for the next two years.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, I digress. When I boarded the bus to the ferry terminal, a good friend of mine with connections to a BMT sergeant texted me a photo of the enlistment
                    sheet for that day. He condescendingly added on a message that I will not forget till this day.
                    <br><br>
                    "haha bro, I think you 3 SIR."
                    <br><br>
                    "Oh god"
                    <br><br>
                    I was in denial. I couldn't believe it. How could I, among the hundreds of thousands enlisting on the 4th of April 2019, be so unlucky.
                    I refused to believe what he told me and I placed blind faith in the hopes that this was just a massive elaborate prank. I only came to process the reality of my situation
                    when the lieutenant-colonel that greeted us in the opening speech started off by saying "welcome to 3 SIR."
                    <br><br>
                    And I lost it. 
                    <br><br>
                    There was nothing to look forward to anymore, my life for the next two years was doomed to be constant outfields, camo on, rifle cleaning and being one with the flora and fuana 
                    of our Motherland. In fact, I hated the idea so much I texted my brother that very day, asking him whether I should just sign on and escape this miserable life.
                    To me, 5 years in a vocation of my choice was suddenly looking very appealing compared to 2 years of whatever that laid in store for me in 3 SIR. 
                    <br><br>
                    My future self would thank me for not committing to this borderline insane idea.

                    <strong>I Almost Signed-on Incident</strong><br>
                    One thing I have to applaud the SAF for is just how efficient and insidious their recruitment tactics are. Having been thrown into a completely new environment that reeks of regimentation, everyone in 
                    the right mind would be looking for ways to escape this predicament. 
                    <br><br>
                    And this is exactly where the SAF recruitment personnel come in. 
                    <br><br>
                    In between the hellish training regime of BMT, recruits are dragged to
                    lecture halls for recruiment talks, where a carefully selected charismatic individual would try to sell you the idea of signing on. They would prepare over-the-top action films, pictures of overseas exercises and 
                    <strong> HUGE </strong>salary numbers to sell this too-good-to-be-true idea to you. On top of that, these recruitment talks are only spaced out over the course of two weeks for all three vocations (Army, Navy, Air Force), as such, you are inherently pressured
                    to indicate your interest in a short period of time or forever miss out on this 'golden opportunity'. You don't even have time to consult your parents/loved ones about this decision over the weekend. I believe this eventually
                    led to multiple impulsive decisions among the regulars.
                    <br><br>
                    I, for one, fell right into their trap. 
                    <br><br>
                    Having heard multiple friends in the January batch decide to sign on as Naval Officers, plus the fact that I knew I was 
                    in mono-intake, the idea of being in the Navy was attractive. You get to live on a ship/submarine, enjoy the delicious food served by the Navy chefs, and go for overseas training exercises. I must admit that military 
                    weddings were extremely lit from the photos that were shown.  
                    <br><br>
                    And just like that, I indicated interest in becoming a Naval Officer.
                    <br><br>
                    What followed were three more rounds of recruitment talks before the contract arrived in front of my laps. They gave you an ultimatum: you either sign it on the spot or if you choose to walk out of the room, you would lose
                    that opportunity forever. 
                    <br><br>
                    How predatory! 
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, the recruitment officer was legally obliged to go through all the terms and conditions with us before we were allowed to sign, and there came a fineprint that even someone as dumb
                    as me knew it was a red flag. I think it went something like this: I will dedicate all my time to the SAF, I am obliged to report for duty whenever I am needed, regardless of circumstances (E.g. weekend/leave). Of course, this sounds perfectly
                    understandable for an occupation involving the defence of the nation. How can one refuse to protect their nation in times of war because they applied for leave on that day. 
                    <br><br>
                    But this clause really got me thinking, do I really value 
                    my time this little? Would I want to live a life under the whim of a single press of a button? 
                    <br><br>
                    Absolutely not.
                    <br><br>
                    With that, I returned the contract, walked out of the lecture hall, and never looked back.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The pseudo-Toilet IC Incident</strong><br>
                    Ah, one cannot mention about army without talking about their toilets. They are surprisingly in decent conditions, obviously due to the insane standards of cleaning that happens in the SAF.
                    <br><br>
                    Every bunk had 16 individuals, and each person had a role. Roles ranged from Learnet IC, toilet IC, armskote men, and so on. I was the fireman of the section. Basically in times of a fire, I was in charge of
                    grabbing the fire extinguisher and fighting the fire.
                    <br><br>
                    Since there was only one toilet IC, they would require the help of another person to clean the toilet each time. Now for some reason, perhaps I look very friendly, maybe I look like someone who finds it hard to say no,
                    but I always ended up helping to clean the toilet. I dreaded every Stand-by-Area because the toilet IC would always approach me and ask me to clean the toilet. I hate it. I HATE IT SO MUCH.
                    <br><br>
                    Imagine plucking out public hair from the urinals, scrubbing the shower walls, cleaning the basin and washing the toilet floor. OH MY GOD, SO DISGUSTINGGGGG! 
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe if I didn't look like a nerd, life could have been better haha.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Buckethead Incident</strong><br>
                    Upon enlistment, everybody would be assigned a bucket, just a standard-sized red bucket meant for you to wash your clothes during BMT as you are only allowed to bring home a limited set of clothes each book out.
                    By convention, these buckets were supposed to be kept faced down, at the foot of your bed. However, since you have to wash your clothes at any given opportunity, many would leave their buckets to dry on the clothing rack outside
                    each bunk. It definitely felt wrong (because it goes against the army's idea of standardisation), but the PTP batch people did it and none of the sergeants ever gave us shit for it. 
                    <br><br>
                    And so I followed their example.
                    <br><br>
                    Now one day, right as we were about the march off for lunch. Our sergeant said:
                    <br><br>
                    "There's something wrong, where did you guys think y'all fucked up?"
                    <br><br>
                    There was confusion all around, we haven't done anything out of routine that day. There were mumblings among the platoon, so we ended up getting knocked down. After we recovered and we still did not figure out what was 
                    wrong, he then said
                    <br><br>
                    "Why the fuck are there buckets on the clothes rack. Who the fuck said you can do that. There are 1, 2, 3 ... 16 FUCKING BUCKETS!!!"
                    <br><br>
                    Oh shit. One of the buckets were mine.
                    <br><br>
                    Everyone knew we were screwed, we just didn't know how screwed. 
                    <br><br>
                    What ensued was peak comedy. We were told to collect all the buckets that were on display and bring it to the first floor. Of course, an impossible timing was given so we ended up getting knocked down yet again. The
                    culprits were then told to each grab their own buckets and fall in in file. Subsequently, we were instructed to "helmets on", and shout out the SAF core values, before repeating "I will not put my bucket on the clothes line again" twenty times.
                    <br><br>
                    If you were someone looking from afar, you would wonder just what the heck 4 by 4 recruits were doing with their buckets covering their whole head. 
                    <br><br>
                    Spending time inside the bucket was incredibly introspective, you start to wonder just what 
                    did you do in life to end up in such a humiliating yet hilarious situation.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Choir Incident</strong><br>
                    The story above doesn't stop there. Right after the legendary buckethead incident, we were allowed to go for lunch. Upon returning to the coyline, our sergeants decided to have some fun with us, and this translated into a never-ending amount of Hentak Kaki commands.
                    With each Hentak Kaki command, we had to end it by singing the "Count by the, count by the, left foot count ah" song. Now this was perfectly normal, just completely unnecessary and tiring. After what felt like 10 renditions of that song, the sergeant was clearly not satisfied.
                    So he brought out a loudspeaker and said to the whole company.
                    <br><br>
                    "I've always had a dream to be the conductor of a choir, and I think today is the day I get to fulfill that dream. You guys see that old storeroom beside the vending machine? When I blast this horn, you have 30s to all fit inside and I want you guys to sing the Hentak Kaki song inside.
                    You won't come out unless I'm satisfied."
                    <br><br>
                    Mind you, this storeroom was fucking old. It was completely empty, it was not ventilated and the air inside was so stale. What's worse? It had an area of about 4 normal-sized cars. How the fuck do you fit 200 people inside such a small space?
                    <br><br>
                    With the blast of the horn, everyone was trying to squeeze inside the room. Of course, we never met the timing so we ended up doing 60 push ups afterwards. Once inside, it was the living definition of claustraphobia. There was literally no space to move, there was in fact no space to breathe at all.
                    I'm amazed at how those that were not naturally gifted in height were able to breathe in that situation. It soon became apparant that this was dangerous as people were screaming that they couldn't breathe. Anyway, we started screaming the Hentak Kaki song  for literally our dear lives and we were eventually 
                    allowed out of that hellhole.
                    <br><br>
                    In hindsight, this was a prime example of calling the safety hotline and getting someone into DB. 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The IPPT Incident</strong><br>
                    Ah, the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT), the bane of my existence in BMT. For the record, prior to national service, I was never that fit. I always managed to get by by scoring comfortably between the pass and silver bracket. 
                    <br><br>
                    In BMT, IPPT is especially important if you are looking to go into command school, a minimum of silver is required, though I've seen a handful of exceptions who passed and still managed to go to command school. I, for one, wanted to go command school because I didn't want to go to 3 SIR straight 
                    away after BMT, so I worked my ass off trying to get silver. 
                    <br><br>
                    Before I get into the story, you must understand just what was at stake here. It was the last IPPT session conducted during BMT, which means the IPPT score from this test would be used in the evaluation on whether you are eligible for command school. All the previous IPPTs, I've only managed to pass, so I was hell bent 
                    on getting silver this time around. But alas, the heavens decided that that would not be my destiny for that day.
                    <br><br>
                    The first station was push-ups. Being technologically advanced (though I would argue technologically backwards), the SAF uses the ELISE machine to count the repetitions for static stations (push ups and sit ups). Unless your form is perfect, you would hear all sorts of nonsense coming from the machine such as 
                    "raise butt", "straighten back", "Go lower". It was infuriating but one had to live with it. The common tactic was that if you did your initial 20 repetitions and the machines registered multiple no counts, it would be better to retry the station rather than waste your energy continuing. Which is exactly what happened to me. I did my 
                    first 30, and it only registered 15, so I decided I would redo the station, no harm right?
                    <br><br>
                    Well sucks to be you Yin Jian because fate decided to give you the middle finger that day.
                    <br><br>
                    Here I am, my second time attempting the push up station. At this point, there were two female officers fiddling with the ELISE machine that was recording my attempt. I thought it was weird but they said to carry on, which I obviously did. The machine worked perfectly fine, registering all my repetitions, until around the 25th mark, when the 
                    machine just decided to give up on life and shut down.
                    <br><br>
                    What the fuck.
                    <br><br>
                    I looked at the two female officers fiddling with the ELISE machine and told them that it had turned off while I was doing my attempt. 
                    <br><br>
                    "Oops! Sorry! You go try again"
                    <br><br>
                    WHAT THE FUCK???!!!! HELLO, I HAD ALREADY DONE CLOSE TO 60 REPETITIONS IN THE LAST 5 MINS. AM I SUPERMAN? DO YOU THINK I'M NOT TIRED?
                    <br><br>
                    At that point, hopes of getting silver was no longer in my mind, the idea of failing my last IPPT suddenly became very real.
                    <br><br>
                    I ended up doing the push-up station again and getting by with 33 repetitions.
                    <br><br>
                    Next was the sit-up station. Already pissed beyond belief, I just wanted to get this over and done with. I strapped myself down and started my sit-ups only to find out after giving it my all that the machine malfunctioned and recorded that I did 999 situps. What in the world? I went to the fitness instructor and told him of my predicament and all I got
                    was to try again at another machine.
                    <br><br>
                    I must have been the fittest man alive that day because while everyone did one trial of IPPT, I think I did 2.
                    <br><br>
                    I ended up barely scrapping through the sit-up station.
                    <br><br>
                    Last but no least, we had our 2.4km run. At this point, I just wanted to pass IPPT and not think about it anymore. To hell with going to command school, 3 SIR just take me in please, just end my current misery. My score up till that point was teetering on failure (less that 60 points) and I had to run like my life depended on it just to even pass. And so I did. Except
                    it turned out that I ran just enough to get 59 points.
                    <br><br>
                    I failed IPPT by one point... 
                    <br><br>
                    You know what that means! Remedial training WOOHOO!
                    <br><br>
                    The next day, everybody got to book out on a Thursday night, while I had to stay back all the way till Friday evening to retake IPPT. By some stroke of luck, I managed to get silver.
                    <br><br>
                    Till this day, I don't know whether this incident was a blessing or a curse, because I believe retaking IPPT was the reason why I got into command school in the end.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Night Blindness Incident</strong>
                    <br>
                    One thing that army really made me start to appreciate a lot more is just how brightly lit the city is. For those who have never been outfield before, you don't know how 
                    privileged we are to have such a good coverage of lighting in our streets and homes. I used to think that I was not afraid of the dark, because up till then, I have never experienced
                    what was truly pitch-dark. 
                    <br><br>
                    Once you are in the forest at night under dense vegetation without any artificial light or moonlight, you would understand how I feel. No one can see anything.
                    You can't even see the person standing right in front of you, much less your own hands. When we were told to navigate around like this, I was scared shitless. 
                    <br><br>
                    That's not even the worst thing. 
                    <br><br>
                    During field camp, we had to sleep inside the shellscrape that we dug for a night, and I had the fright of my life when I woke up. Imagine having your eyes wide open but you see absolutely nothing. 
                    You can't even tell up from down. In fact, in that moment of confusion, I thought I had either gone blind or insane. 
                    <br><br>
                    Nature is humbling in its own ways huh.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Crying Incident</strong><br>
                    For those who know me, I would say I am not an emotionally expressive person. I tend to deal with my emotions internally, and I think I rarely display it for others to see. I believe the last time I cried 
                    before army was in primary school. 
                    <br><br>
                    However, field camp did had me balling my eyes out. 
                    <br><br>
                    I remember it was the fourth day of field camp, we hadn't seen civilisation for god knows how long, we hadn't eaten proper 
                    food for even longer. The PC decided to gather everyone together, and started reminding us on the reason why NS exists, citing reasons about protecting our loved ones in times of war. The speech itself was not memorable
                    nor was it emotionally-invoking, but for some reason, I just felt tears roll down my eyes. 
                    <br><br>
                    Of course my dignity didn't allow me to cry in front of a whole bunch of men, so I tried to keep it in for a while. I soon realised that there were others around me crying too so I sort of just gave up and let loose. Man, it was 
                    cathartic. The Army has its ways of making you really miss your family and friends. Anyway, they commemerated that occasion by giving us fresh rations for the first time in so many days, along with 100 Plus! We were then each issued
                    an envelope that was prepared by our family, which contained photos and a letter.
                    <br><br>
                    That was it for me. I cried so hard AHAHAH.
                    <br><br>
                    It was pitch dark at that point and they told us to write a letter back to our family. So there I was, having a torchlight strapped on to the rubberband on my helmet, using a broken pen, with tears and snot on my face, I wrote the 
                    cringiest letter in my life.

                    <strong>When Men Became Cowards Incident</strong><br>
                    What would BMT be without some sort of supernatural events! Unfortunately for my readers, this story isn't some encounter with some supernatural being, but rather how our whole platoon 
                    reacted to the haunting of another platoon. 
                    <br><br>
                    On the last week of our BMT, the recruits of the section living above us started complaining about the banging and scratching of an unused locker in their bunk. The officer subsequently visited the bunk at night and confirmed
                    their observations, there were indeed weird noises coming from the locker. However, there was nothing to be done about it. The officer left the recruits with his beret, because apparantly the Singapore Crest was blessed by all the different religions so it would serve as a 
                    deterrence to any supernatural events. 
                    <br><br>
                    Upon getting the wind of this, my bunk was scared shitless. What if we were the next victims?
                    <br><br>
                    Hell fucking no. We were having none of it.
                    <br><br>
                    For the rest of the final week of BMT, we would carry our mattress onto the floor and put it side by side with one another to sleep. Strength in numbers right! You would see people pulling out talismans and necklaces to ward off all kinds of evil, some even said prayers and did rituals.
                    <br><br>
                    Thinking back, this was so cowardly of us but I guess mass paranoia is not something to be underestimated!
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Final Stand-By-Bed Incident</strong><br>
                    Stand-By-Bed (SBB). The sadistic punishment that all our sergeants and officers like to pull on us. For the uninitiated, there are three forms of cleaniness checks.
                </p>
                <ul class="main-text">
                    <li>Stand-By-Area: This is the most common occurence. You are supposed to clean your bunk, the toilet and the common areas.</li>
                    <li>Stand-By-Bed: This is when your superiors are feeling cute. You are supposed to do everything in Stand-By-Area, but you have to open your locker and everything is held at higher standards</li>
                    <li>Stand-By-Universe: They strip you of your dignity. You do everything in Stand-By-Bed and they will check literally every personal belonging from the inside out. Only done in extreme cases when there are theft or foul play involved.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="main-text">
                    On the last bookout before our 24km route march, we were subjected to the worst but funniest punishments I've ever had in BMT. We were given the period after lunch till last parade to prepare for SBB. Everyone was obviously excited because this was our final bookout, so we
                    wanted to do a good job in cleaning to book out early. We spent 1 hour using the firehose to clean the corridor, the bunk and the toilet which turned out to be really effective. Honestly till today, I think that was the best cleaning I've ever done in my life.
                    <br><br>
                    Since we were section 4, we had to wait for the rest of the platoon to finish getting checked before it was our turn. While waiting in anticipation, you can hear the distant slamming of lockers and people shouting "Down! Down! Down!".
                    <br><br>
                    It was clearly not looking too hot.
                    <br><br>
                    When the first sergeant came to our section, took a peek inside the bunk, and straight up told us to hold the push up position. I think we ended up doing about 40 push ups and 20 crunches before he left.
                    <br><br>
                    Thinking it was over, we resumed chit-chatting and preparing for bookout.
                    <br><br>
                    Boy were we wrong.
                    <br><br>
                    The next sergeant came into our bunk and told us to knock it down again. Confused, we just did as we were told. They then began checking each person's bed one by one, going down the 4D number. At each bed, they would find the slightest amount of dust, and they would ask you why it was 
                    there. It soon became apparant that this SBB was designed to fail. 
                    <br><br>
                    This ain't no stand by bed, this was a buttfuck session.
                    <br><br>
                    What ensued was absolute chaos, just constant screaming and shouting. There were 3 sergeants in the room, constantly running about, finding the smallest fault in our bunk. I remember at some point they pointed up towards the ceiling and asked the IC why there was dust up there. The IC simply
                    had nothing to say other than that we didn't see it (Who the hell cleans the ceiling????). When they came to my bed, they asked why my pillow wasn't pulled. The reason why it wasn't pulled was because the previous sergeant threw it around, of course it wasn't going to be pulled after going through
                    that treatment. But what can I say, I just nodded my head and faced the ground. In my haste to do my punishment, I kicked the door of my locker. 
                    <br><br>
                    And the crowd went wild. More screaming and shouting.
                    <br><br>
                    I ended up doing each push-up while shouting "Sorry locker, I won't kick you again".
                    <br><br>
                    When they went through each individual's bed, we all breathed a sigh of relief, thinking it was over. But nope. One of the sergeant said
                    <br><br>
                    "Section 4, I'm so disappointed in you today. Where are the usual high standards??!! We give you two hours to clean and this is the shit you give us? Nevermind, I want all of you to bring your padlock and put it on the table here."
                    <br><br>
                    Now what do we have here?
                    <br><br>
                    The sergeant proceeded to chain 16 padlocks together into what I can only call a lock-bomb. 
                    <br><br>
                    "When I say go, I want you all to find your own padlock and put it onto your locker. How long do y'all need? No one wants to answer? Okay, 30 seconds."
                    <br><br>
                    And so we had 30 seconds to defuse this lock-bomb. None of us had any idea what the key combination of each other's padlock were. To top it off, unlocking your own padlock usually took about 3 seconds because it involved turning the lock to three unique numbers, from 
                    clockwise to counter-clockwise to clockwise. How was it even possible to do this when all 16 padlocks are put together?
                    <br><br>
                    Like everything in SAF, this punishment was designed to fail. 
                    <br><br>
                    And what ensued was countless push-ups and crunches and ending it off by lying flat on the floor and kissing it for 10 minutes. Oh man, the things they make you do in the SAF are so wild.
                    <br><br>
                    And that was not even the end of it. We were then told to clean the bunk again for another inspection in 30 minutes. During that inspection, we were told to hold the push-up position at the corridor while they checked our room. I remember a hilarious exchange between the 
                    sergeant and one of the jokers in my section. 
                    <br><br>
                    Sergeant: "Oi, who said you can move!"
                    <br><br>
                    Section-mate: "Sergeant! Got mosquito, what if I get dengue"
                    <br><br>
                    Sergeant: "I fuck you! Mosquito how big you how big, who bigger you tell me?"
                    <br><br>
                    Section-mate: "I bigger sergeant..."
                    <br><br>
                    Sergeant: "Then why you scared? Mosquito also have a family right? They suck your blood to provide for their family right? You think it's right for us to deny them their livelihood?"
                    <br><br>
                    Whole section: "..."
                    <br><br>
                    Sergeant: "Nevermind! Everyone 20! Each time you do one push-up, I want you guys to say sorry mosquito, please suck my blood."
                    <br><br>
                    And we certainly did that, while laughing our asses off.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>BMT in a nutshell</strong><br>
                    BMT was one hell of a ride, there were no highs and only lows. However, I guess the things we did were interesting? From the route marches, the songs we had to sing during our route march,
                    the grenade throwing, the live firing, the Urban Ops, the field camp, and the mealtime regimes. Not forgetting to mention, the insanely late bookouts and early bookins we had because our company was located in School 4.
                    Unlike School 1 to 3 that are located right beside the ferry terminal, School 4 is located at the very heart of Pulau Tekong, which means we have to 
                    take a vehicle for each book in and book out, and that translated to abysmal book-in/out timings.
                    <br><br>
                    There was also the final 24km route march, which was shit in and of itself, but I guess it made me appreciate Singapore a little more. The POP parade was kinda lit though, I should have thrown my jockey cap higher and further away!

            <h5>For every Singaporean son <br>
            Must serve his term until he's done <br>
            And every single breath he takes <br>
            Comes a bond which cannot break <br><br>
            
            We've been through lightning, rain and sun <br>
            Now we're back to where we first begun <br>
            Through walls of fire we once run <br>
            Forget your friend, you know I can't </h5></a>
