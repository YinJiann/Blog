                    National Service: The bane of every Singaporean son. 
                    <br><br>
                    Some are neutral about it, few love it and would go on to make it about their whole identity (you could say their lives peaked in NS), but I would
                    say that the majority of guys absolutely hated it.
                    <br><br>
                    I was no exception.
                    <br><br>
                    Back in school, national service was a concept that always seemed distant to me. Don't get me wrong, I knew it was something I had to face
                    when I finished JC, but it just seemed always barely out of reach. Back then, the only exposure I had were the ridiculous stories that 
                    my brother share. He made NS sound like something out of a fiction book, meaningless but yet unending in entertainment.
                    <br><br>
                    Back then, I confess I was affected by the propoganda of our government that is the Ah Boys To Men films. Before we would even enlist, selected individuals
                    would be notified that they are eligible for the prestigious elite units of the army, namely the Naval Diving Unit (NDU) and the Commandos. There were only two
                    extremes to the reactions upon receiving the letters: utter despair and pure elation. I, of course, had hopes of receiving a letter from NDU, because I was thoroughly converted by the Ah Boys
                    To Men: Frogmen film, but alas, the only letter I got was to report to BMTC.
                    <br><br>
                    In hindsight, this was a blessing in disguise.

                    <strong>The Mono-intake Incident</strong><br>
                    I was one of the unfortunates of the JC batch to enlist in April. Having seen almost everyone around me enlist during January, I honestly felt left behind. 
                    <br><br>
                    What's the worst thing
                    about enlisting in April? 
                    <br><br>
                    You have no friends to send you off ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, I enlisted on the 4th of April 2019. Before enlistment, my brother would tell me one thing: Pray you don't get into mono-intake. Now for the readers who 
                    are unfamiliar with this term, mono intake happens when an individual wins the lottery ticket. Due to supposed manpower issues, randomly selected individuals
                    would have a unit assigned to them prior to their enlistment, meaning that their future in NS has been decided on day one. This is unlike everyone else, whose unit
                    are often decided when they pass out from BMT (men)/ graduate from command school (sergeants/officers). 
                    <br><br>
                    So why exactly is mono intake undesirable? Well it's because mono-intake only occurs for combat units such as Singapore Infantry Regiment (SIR), Singapore Armoured
                    Regiment (SAR), Guards and elite units. These units are no fun. Once you are considered mono-intake, you can kiss your ass goodbye to all the good postings such as CMPB, Navy, Air Force, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    But one should not lose hope should they be assigned into mono-intake. CMPB accounts for attrition rates for each intake, there will bound to be people 
                    who will end up downpes-ing and becoming non-combat fit. As such, one actually has a slim chance of escaping mono-intake. So for those 
                    who are reading this and are currently in mono-intake, keep your chin up king, you might just still have a shot at life for the next two years.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, I digress. Back to the story! When I boarded the bus to the ferry terminal, a good friend of mine with connections to a BMT sergeant texted me a photo of the enlistment
                    sheet for that day. He added on with a message I will not forget till this day.
                    <br><br>
                    "haha bro, I think you 3 SIR."
                    <br><br>
                    "What the fuck"
                    <br><br>
                    I was in denial. I couldn't believe it. How could I, among the hundreds of thousands enlisting on the fucking 4th of April 2019, be so unlucky.
                    I refused to believe what he told me and I placed blind faith in the hopes that this was a massive elaborate prank. I only came to process the reality of my situation
                    when the lieutenant-colonel that greeted us in the opening speech started off by saying "welcome to 3 SIR."
                    <br><br>
                    And I lost it. 
                    <br><br>
                    There was nothing to look forward to anymore, my life for the next two years was doomed to be constant outfields, camo on, rifle cleaning and being one with the flora and fuana 
                    of our Motherland. In fact, I hated the idea so much I went to text my brother that very day, asking him whether I should just sign on and escape this miserable life.
                    To me, 5 years in a vocation of my choice was suddenly looking very appealing compared to 2 years of whatever that laid in store for me in 3 SIR. 
                    <br><br>
                    My future self would thank me for not committing to this borderline insane idea.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Night Blindness Incident</strong>
                    <br>
                    I think one thing that army really made me start to appreciate a lot more is just how brightly lit the city is. For those who have never been outfield before, you don't know how 
                    privileged we are to have such a good coverage of lighting in our streets and homes. I used to think that I was not afraid of the dark, because up till then, I have never experienced
                    what was truly pitch-dark. 
                    <br><br>
                    Once you are in the forest at night under dense vegetation without any artificial light or moonlight, you would understand how I feel. No one can see anything.
                    You can't even see the person standing right in front of you, much less your own hands. When we were told to navigate around like this, I was scared shitless. 
                    <br><br>
                    That's not even the worst thing. 
                    <br><br>
                    During field camp, we had to sleep inside the shellscrape that we dug for a night, and I had the fright of my life when I woke up. Imagine having your eyes wide open but you see absolutely nothing. 
                    You can't even tell up from down. In fact, in that moment of confusion, I thought I had either gone blind or insane. I guess Mother Nature really knows how to 
                    put one in their place.
