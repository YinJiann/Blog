                    National Service: The bane of every Singaporean son. 
                    <br><br>
                    Some are neutral about it, few love it and would go on to make it about their whole identity (you could say their lives peaked in NS), but I would
                    say that majority of guys absolutely hated it.
                    <br><br>
                    I was no exception.
                    <br><br>
                    Back in school, national service was a concept that always seemed distant to me. Don't get me wrong, I knew it was something I had to face
                    when I finished JC, but it just seemed always barely out of reach. Back then, the only exposure I had were the ridiculous stories that 
                    my brother would share with em. He made NS sound like something out of a fiction book, meaningless but yet unending in entertainment.
                    <br><br>
                    Back then, I confess I was completely sold by the propoganda of our government: the Ah Boys To Men films. Before we would even enlist, selected individuals
                    would be notified that they are eligible for the prestigious elite units of the army, namely the Naval Diving Unit (NDU) and the Commandos. There were only two
                    extremes to the reactions upon receiving the letters: utter despair and pure elation. I, of course, had hopes of receiving a letter from NDU, because I was thoroughly converted by the Ah Boys
                    To Men: Frogmen film, but alas, the only letter I got was to report to BMTC.
                    <br><br>
                    In hindsight, this was a blessing in disguise.

                    <strong>The Mono-intake Incident</strong><br>
                    I enlisted on the 4th of April 2019. I was one of the unfortunates of the JC batch to enlist in April. Having seen almost everyone around me enlist during January, I honestly felt left behind. 
                    <br><br>
                    Before enlistment, my brother would tell me one and only one thing: Just don't get into mono-intake. Now for those
                    unfamiliar with this term, mono intake happens when an individual wins the lottery ticket. Due to supposed manpower issues, randomly selected individuals
                    would have a unit assigned to them prior to their enlistment, meaning that their future in NS has been decided on day one. This is unlike everyone else, whose units
                    are often decided when they pass out from BMT (men)/ graduate from command school (sergeants/officers). 
                    <br><br>
                    So why exactly is mono intake undesirable? Well it's because mono-intake only occurs for combat units such as Singapore Infantry Regiment (SIR), Singapore Armoured
                    Regiment (SAR), Guards, NDU and the Commandos. These units are no fun. Once you are considered mono-intake, you can kiss your ass goodbye to all the good postings such as Transport, Navy, Air Force, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    But one should not lose hope if they are assigned into mono-intake. CMPB accounts for attrition rates in each intake, there will bound to be people 
                    who will end up being injured and becoming non-combat fit. As such, one actually has a slim chance of getting posted out. So for those 
                    wallowing in self-despair at the news of your mono-intake, keep your chin up king, you might just still have a shot at life for the next two years.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, I digress. When I boarded the bus to the ferry terminal, Matthew texted me a photo of the enlistment
                    sheet for that day. He added on a message that I will not forget till this day.
                    <br><br>
                    "bro, I think you 3 SIR."
                    <br><br>
                    "Oh god"
                    <br><br>
                    I was in denial. I couldn't believe it. 
                    <br><br>
                    How could I, among the hundreds of thousands enlisting on the 4th of April 2019, be so unlucky.
                    I refused to believe what he told me and I placed blind faith in the hopes that this was just a massive elaborate prank. I only came to process  reality 
                    when the lieutenant-colonel that greeted us in the opening speech started off by saying "welcome to 3 SIR."
                    <br><br>
                    I lost it. 
                    <br><br>
                    There was nothing to look forward to anymore, my life for the next two years was doomed to be constant outfields, camo on, rifle cleaning and being one with the flora and fuana 
                    of our Motherland. In fact, I hated the idea so much I texted my brother that very day, asking him whether I should just sign on and escape this miserable life.
                    To me, 5 years in a vocation of my choice was suddenly looking very appealing compared to 2 years of whatever that laid in store for me in 3 SIR. 
                    <br><br>
                    My future self would thank me for not committing to this borderline insane idea.

                    <strong>I Almost Signed-on Incident</strong><br>
                    One thing I have to applaud the SAF for is just how efficient and insidious their recruitment tactics are. Having been thrown into a completely new environment that reeks of regimentation, everyone in 
                    the right mind would be looking for ways to escape this predicament. 
                    <br><br>
                    And this is exactly where the SAF recruitment personnel come in. 
                    <br><br>
                    In between the hellish training regime of BMT, recruits are dragged to
                    lecture halls for recruitment talks, where carefully selected, charismatic individuals would try to sell you the idea of signing on. They would prepare over-the-top action films, pictures of overseas exercises and 
                    <strong> HUGE </strong>salary numbers to sell this too-good-to-be-true idea to you. On top of that, these recruitment talks are only spaced out over the course of two weeks for all three vocations (Army, Navy, Air Force). As such, you are inherently pressured
                    to indicate your interest in a short period of time or forever miss out on this 'golden opportunity'. You don't even have time to consult your parents/loved ones about this decision over the weekend. I believe this eventually
                    led to multiple impulsive decisions among the regulars.
                    <br><br>
                    I, for one, fell right into their trap. 
                    <br><br>
                    Having heard multiple friends in the January batch decide to sign on as Naval Officers, plus the fact that I knew I was 
                    in mono-intake, the idea of being in the Navy was attractive. You get to live on a ship/submarine, enjoy the delicious food served by the Navy chefs, and go for overseas training exercises. I must also wholeheartedly admit that military 
                    weddings were extremely lit from the photos that were shown.  
                    <br><br>
                    And just like that, I indicated interest in becoming a Naval Officer.
                    <br><br>
                    What followed were three more rounds of recruitment talks before the contract arrived in front of my lap. They gave you an ultimatum: you either sign it on the spot or if you choose to walk out of the room, you would lose
                    that opportunity forever. 
                    <br><br>
                    How predatory! 
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, the recruitment officer was legally obliged to go through all the terms and conditions with us before we were allowed to sign, and there came a fineprint that even someone as dumb
                    as me knew was a red flag. It went something like this: I will dedicate all my time to the SAF, I am obliged to report for duty whenever I am needed, regardless of circumstances (E.g. weekend/leave). Of course, this sounds perfectly
                    understandable for an occupation involving the defence of the nation. How can one refuse to protect their nation in times of war because they applied for leave on that day. 
                    <br><br>
                    But this clause really got me thinking, do I really value 
                    my time this little? Would I want to live a life at the whim of a single press of a button? 
                    <br><br>
                    Absolutely not.
                    <br><br>
                    With that, I returned the contract, walked out of the lecture hall, and never looked back.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The pseudo-Toilet IC Incident</strong><br>
                    Ah, one cannot mention about army without talking about their toilets. They are surprisingly in decent conditions, obviously due to the insane standards of cleaning that happens in the SAF.
                    <br><br>
                    Every bunk had 16 individuals, and each person had a role. Roles ranged from Learnet IC, toilet IC, armskote men, and so on. I was the fireman of the section. Basically in times of a fire, I was in charge of
                    grabbing the fire extinguisher and fighting the fire.
                    <br><br>
                    Since there was only one toilet IC, they would require the help of another person to clean the toilet each time. Now for some reason, perhaps I look very friendly, maybe I look like someone who finds it hard to say no,
                    but I always ended up helping to clean the toilet. I dreaded every Stand-by-Area because the toilet IC would always approach me and ask me to clean the toilet. I hate it. I HATE IT SO MUCH.
                    <br><br>
                    Imagine plucking out public hair from the urinals, scrubbing the shower walls, cleaning the basin and washing the toilet floor. OH MY GOD, SO DISGUSTINGGGGG! 
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe if I didn't look like a nerd, life could have been better haha.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Buckethead Incident</strong><br>
                    Upon enlistment, everybody would be assigned a bucket, just a standard-sized red bucket meant for you to wash your clothes during BMT as you are only allowed to bring home a limited set of clothes each book out.
                    By convention, these buckets were supposed to be kept faced down, at the foot of your bed. However, since you have to wash your clothes at any given opportunity, many would leave their buckets to dry on the clothing rack outside
                    each bunk. It definitely felt wrong (because it goes against the army's idea of standardisation), but the PTP batch people did it and none of the sergeants ever gave us shit for it. 
                    <br><br>
                    And so I followed their example.
                    <br><br>
                    Now one day, right as we were about the march off for lunch. Our sergeant said:
                    <br><br>
                    "There's something wrong, where do y'all think it is?"
                    <br><br>
                    There was confusion all around, we haven't done anything out of routine that day. There were mumblings among the platoon, so we ended up getting knocked down. After we recovered and we still did not figure out what was 
                    wrong, he then said
                    <br><br>
                    "Why the fuck are there buckets on the clothes rack. Who the fuck said you can do that. There are 1, 2, 3 ... 21 FUCKING BUCKETS!!!"
                    <br><br>
                    Oh shit. One of the buckets were mine.
                    <br><br>
                    Everyone knew we were screwed, we just didn't know how screwed. 
                    <br><br>
                    What ensued was peak comedy. We were told to collect all the buckets that were on display and bring it to the first floor. Of course, an impossible timing was given so we ended up getting knocked down yet again. The
                    culprits were then told to each grab their own buckets and fall in in file. Subsequently, we were instructed to "helmets on", and shout out the SAF core values, before repeating "I will not put my bucket on the clothes line again" twenty times.
                    <br><br>
                    If you were someone looking from afar, you would wonder just what the heck a 5 by 4 recruits were doing with their buckets covering their whole head. 
                    <br><br>
                    Spending time inside the bucket was incredibly introspective, you start to wonder just what 
                    did you do in life to end up in such a humiliating yet hilarious situation.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Choir Incident</strong><br>
                    The story above doesn't stop there. Right after the legendary buckethead incident, we were allowed to go for lunch. Upon returning to the coyline, our sergeants decided to have some fun with us, and this translated into a never-ending amount of Hentak Kaki commands.
                    With each Hentak Kaki command, we had to end it by singing the "Count by the, count by the, left foot count ah" song. Now this was perfectly normal, just completely unnecessary and tiring. After what felt like 10 renditions of that song, the sergeant was clearly not satisfied.
                    So he brought out a loudspeaker and said to the whole company.
                    <br><br>
                    "I've always had a dream to be the conductor of a choir, and I think today is the day I get to fulfill that dream. You guys see that old storeroom beside the vending machine? When I blast this horn, you have 30s to all fit inside and I want you guys to sing the Hentak Kaki song inside.
                    You won't come out unless I'm satisfied."
                    <br><br>
                    Mind you, this storeroom was fucking old. It was completely empty, it was not ventilated and the air inside was so stale. What's worse? It had an area of about 4 normal-sized cars. How the fuck do you fit 200 people inside such a small space?
                    <br><br>
                    With the blast of the horn, everyone was trying to squeeze inside the room. Of course, we never met the timing so we ended up doing 60 push ups afterwards. Once inside, it was the living definition of claustrophobia. There was literally no space to move, there was, in fact, no space to breathe at all.
                    I'm amazed at how those that were not naturally gifted in height were able to breathe in that situation. It soon became apparant that this was dangerous as people were claiming that they couldn't breathe. Anyway, we started screaming the Hentak Kaki song for literally our dear lives and we were eventually 
                    allowed out of that hellhole.
                    <br><br>
                    In hindsight, this was a prime example of calling the safety hotline and getting someone into DB. 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The IPPT Incident</strong><br>
                    Ah, the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT), the bane of my existence in BMT. For the record, prior to national service, I was never that fit. I always managed to scrape by by scoring comfortably between the pass and silver bracket.

                    In BMT, IPPT is especially important if you are looking to go into command school. A minimum of silver is required, though I've seen a handful of exceptions who passed and still managed to go to command school. I, for one, wanted to go command school because I didn't want to go to 3 SIR straight 
                    away after BMT, so I worked my ass off trying to get silver. 
                    <br><br>
                    Before I get into the story, you must understand just what was at stake here. It was the last IPPT session conducted during BMT, which means this IPPT score would be used in the evaluation on whether you are eligible for command school. All the previous IPPTs, I've only managed to pass, so I was hell bent 
                    on getting silver this time around. But alas, the heavens decided that that would not be my destiny for that day.
                    <br><br>
                    The first station was push-ups. Being technologically advanced (though I would argue technologically backwards), the SAF uses the ELISE machine to count the repetitions for static stations (push ups and sit ups). Unless your form is perfect, you would hear all sorts of nonsense coming from the machine such as 
                    "raise butt", "straighten back", "Go lower". It was infuriating but one had to live with it. The common tactic was that if your initial 20 repetitions registered multiple no counts, it would be better to retry the station rather than waste your energy continuing. Which is exactly what happened to me. I did my 
                    first 30, and it only registered 15, so I decided I would redo the station, no harm right?
                    <br><br>
                    Well sucks to be you Yin Jian because fate decided to give you the middle finger that day.
                    <br><br>
                    Here I am, my second time attempting the push up station. At this point, there were two female officers fiddling with the ELISE machine that was recording my attempt. I thought it was weird but they resassured me to carry on, and I did. The machine worked perfectly fine, registering all my repetitions, until around the 25th mark, when the 
                    machine just decided to give up on life and shut down.
                    <br><br>
                    What the fuck.
                    <br><br>
                    I looked at the two female officers fiddling with the ELISE machine and told them that it had turned off while I was doing my attempt. 
                    <br><br>
                    "Oops! Sorry! You go try again"
                    <br><br>
                    WHAT THE FUCK???!!!! HELLO, I'VE ALREADY DONE CLOSE TO 60 PUSH UPS IN THE LAST 5 MINS. AM I SUPERMAN? DO YOU THINK I'M NOT TIRED?
                    <br><br>
                    At that point, hopes of getting silver was no longer in my mind, the idea of failing my last IPPT suddenly became very real.
                    <br><br>
                    I ended up doing the push-up station again and getting by with 33 repetitions.
                    <br><br>
                    Next was the sit-up station. Already pissed beyond belief, I just wanted to get this over and done with. I strapped myself down and started my sit-ups only to find out after giving it my all that the machine malfunctioned and recorded that I did 999 situps. What in the world? I went to the fitness instructor and told him of my predicament and all I got
                    was to try again at another machine.
                    <br><br>
                    I must have been the fittest man alive that day because while everyone did one trial of IPPT, I think I did 2.
                    <br><br>
                    I ended up barely scrapping through the sit-up station.
                    <br><br>
                    Last but no least, we had our 2.4km run. At this point, I just wanted to pass IPPT and not think about it anymore. To hell with going to command school, 3 SIR just take me in please, anything to end my current misery. My score up till that point was teetering on failure (less that 60 points) and I had to run like my life depended on it just to even pass. And so I did. Except
                    it turned out that I ran just enough to get 59 points.
                    <br><br>
                    I failed IPPT by one point... 
                    <br><br>
                    You know what that means! Remedial training WOOHOO!
                    <br><br>
                    The next day, everybody got to book out on a Thursday night, while I had to stay back all the way till Friday evening to retake IPPT. By some stroke of luck, I managed to get silver.
                    <br><br>
                    Till this day, I don't know whether this incident was a blessing or a curse, because I believe retaking IPPT was the reason why I got into command school in the end.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Night Blindness Incident</strong>
                    <br>
                    One thing that army really made me start to appreciate a lot more is just how brightly lit the city is. For those who have never been outfield before, you don't know how 
                    privileged we are to have such a good coverage of lighting in our streets and homes. I used to think that I was not afraid of the dark, because up till then, I have never experienced
                    what was truly pitch-dark. 
                    <br><br>
                    Once you are in the forest at night under dense vegetation without any artificial light or moonlight, you would understand how I feel. No one can see anything.
                    You can't even see the person standing right in front of you, much less your own hands. There could be a pothole in front of you and you would be none the wiser, until you fall into it of course. When we were told to navigate around like this, I was scared shitless. 
                    <br><br>
                    That's not even the worst thing. 
                    <br><br>
                    During field camp, we had to sleep inside the shellscrape that we dug for a night, and I had the fright of my life when I woke up. Imagine having your eyes wide open but you see absolutely nothing. 
                    You can't even tell up from down. In fact, in that moment of confusion, I thought I had either gone blind or insane. 
                    <br><br>
                    Nature is humbling in its own ways huh.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Crying Incident</strong><br>
                    For those who know me, I would say I am not an emotionally expressive person. I tend to deal with my emotions internally, and I rarely display it for others to see. I believe the last time I cried 
                    before army was in primary school. 
                    <br><br>
                    However, field camp did had me balling my eyes out. 
                    <br><br>
                    I remember it was the fourth day of field camp, we hadn't seen civilisation for god knows how long, we hadn't eaten proper 
                    food for even longer. The PC decided to gather everyone together, and started reminding us on why NS exists, citing reasons about protecting our loved ones. The speech itself was not memorable
                    nor was it emotionally-invoking, but for some reason, I just felt tears roll down my eyes. 
                    <br><br>
                    Of course my dignity didn't allow me to cry in front of a whole bunch of men, so I tried to keep it in for a while. I soon realised that there were others around me crying too so I sort of just gave up and let loose. 
                    <br><br>
                    Man, it was 
                    cathartic. 
                    <br><br>
                    The Army has its ways of making you really miss your family and friends. Anyway, they commemorated that occasion by giving us fresh rations for the first time in so many days, along with 100 Plus! We were then each issued
                    an envelope that was prepared by our family, which contained photos and a letter.
                    <br><br>
                    That was it for me. I cried so hard AHAHAH.
                    <br><br>
                    It was pitch dark at that point and they told us to write a letter back to our family. So there I was, a torchlight strapped on to my helmet, using a broken pen, with tears in my eyes and snot up my nose, I wrote the 
                    cringiest letter in my life.

                    <strong>When Men Became Cowards Incident</strong><br>
                    What would BMT be without some sort of supernatural event! Unfortunately, this story isn't some encounter with some supernatural being, but rather how our whole platoon 
                    reacted to the haunting of another platoon. 
                    <br><br>
                    On the last week of our BMT, the recruits of the section living above us started complaining about the banging and scratching of an unused locker in their bunk. The officer subsequently visited the bunk at night and confirmed
                    their observations, there were indeed weird noises coming from the locker. However, there was nothing to be done about it. The officer left the recruits with his beret, because apparantly the Singapore Crest was blessed by all the different religions so it would serve as a 
                    deterrence to any supernatural events. 
                    <br><br>
                    Upon getting wind of this, my bunk was scared shitless. What if our happy friend above decided to take a field trip one floor below into our bunk?
                    <br><br>
                    Hell fucking no. We were having none of it.
                    <br><br>
                    For the rest of the final week of BMT, we would carry our mattresses onto the floor and put it side by side with one another to sleep. Strength in numbers right! You would see people pulling out talismans and necklaces to ward off all kinds of evil, some even said prayers and did rituals.
                    <br><br>
                    Thinking back, this was so cowardly of us but I guess mass paranoia is not something to be underestimated!
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Final Stand-By-Bed Incident</strong><br>
                    Stand-By-Bed (SBB). The sadistic punishment that our superiors like to pull on us. For the uninitiated, there are three forms of cleaniness checks.
                </p>
                <ul class="main-text">
                    <li>Stand-By-Area: This is the most common occurence. You are supposed to clean your bunk, the toilet and the common areas.</li>
                    <li>Stand-By-Bed: This is when your superiors are feeling cute. You are supposed to do everything in Stand-By-Area, but you have to open your locker and everything is held at higher standards.</li>
                    <li>Stand-By-Universe: They strip you of your dignity. You do everything in Stand-By-Bed and they will check literally every personal belonging from the inside out (even inside your underwear). Only done in extreme cases when there is theft or foul play involved.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="main-text">
                    On the last bookout before our 24km route march, we were subjected to the worst but funniest punishments I've ever had in BMT. We were given the period after lunch till last parade to prepare for SBB. Everyone was obviously excited because this was our final bookout, so we
                    wanted to do a good job in cleaning to book out early. We spent 1 hour using the firehose to clean the corridor, the bunk and the toilet which turned out to be really effective. Honestly till today, I think that was the best cleaning I've ever done in my life.
                    <br><br>
                    Since we were section 4, we had to wait for the rest of the platoon to finish getting checked before it was our turn. While waiting in anticipation, you can hear the distant slamming of lockers and people shouting "Down! Down! Down!".
                    <br><br>
                    It was clearly not looking too hot.
                    <br><br>
                    When the first sergeant came to our section, took a peek inside the bunk, and straight up told us to hold the push up position. I think we ended up doing about 40 push ups and 20 crunches before he left.
                    <br><br>
                    Thinking it was over, we resumed chit-chatting and preparing for bookout.
                    <br><br>
                    Boy were we wrong.
                    <br><br>
                    The next sergeant came into our bunk and told us to knock it down again. Confused, we just did as we were told. They then began checking each person's bed one by one, going down the 4D number. At each bed, they would find the
                    most ridiculous errors. Oh, your shoes are not aligned by 0.1cm? Push-up. There is one tiny speck of dust inside your locker? Push-up. I think you guys get the idea already.
                    <br><br>
                    This SBB was designed to fail.
                    This ain't no stand by bed, this was a buttfuck session.
                    <br><br>
                    What ensued was absolute chaos, just constant screaming and shouting. There were 3 sergeants in the room, constantly running about, finding the smallest fault in our bunk. I remember at some point they pointed up towards the ceiling and asked the IC why there was dust up there. The IC simply
                    had nothing to say other than that we didn't see it (Who the hell cleans the ceiling????). When they came to my bed, they asked why my pillow wasn't pulled. The reason why it wasn't pulled was because the previous sergeant threw it around, of course it wasn't going to be pulled after going through
                    that treatment. But what can I say? I just nodded my head and faced the ground. In my haste to do my punishment, I kicked the door of my locker. 
                    <br><br>
                    And the crowd went wild. More screaming and shouting.
                    <br><br>
                    I ended up doing each push-up while shouting "Sorry locker, I won't kick you again".
                    <br><br>
                    When they were finally done with everyone's bed, we all breathed a sigh of relief, thinking it was over. But nope. One of the sergeant said
                    <br><br>
                    "Section 4, I'm so disappointed in you today. Where are the usual high standards??!! We give you two hours to clean and this is the shit you give us? Nevermind, bring all your padlocks here and put it on the table."
                    <br><br>
                    Now what do we have here?
                    <br><br>
                    The sergeant proceeded to lock 16 padlocks together into what I can only call a lock-bomb. 
                    <br><br>
                    "I want you all to find your own padlock and put it onto your locker. How long do y'all need? No one wants to answer? Okay, 30 seconds."
                    <br><br>
                    And so we had 30 seconds to defuse this lock-bomb. None of us had any idea what the key combination of each other's padlock were. To top it off, unlocking your own padlock usually took about 3 seconds because it involved turning the lock to three unique numbers, from 
                    clockwise to counter-clockwise to clockwise. How was it even possible to do this when all 16 padlocks are put together?
                    <br><br>
                    Like everything in SAF, this punishment was designed to fail. 
                    <br><br>
                    What ensued was countless push-ups, crunches, bear-crawling and jumping jacks. We ended it off by being in the Senang-Diri position, except we were lying flat on the floor and kissing it for 10 minutes. Oh man, the things they make you do in the SAF are so wild.
                    <br><br>
                    And that was not even the end of it. We were then told to clean the bunk again for another inspection in 30 minutes. During that inspection, we were told to hold the push-up position at the corridor while they checked our room. I remember a hilarious exchange between the 
                    sergeant and my section-mate. 
                    <br><br>
                    Sergeant: "Oi Diva, who said you can move!"
                    <br><br>
                    Diva: "Sergeant! Got mosquito, what if I get dengue"
                    <br><br>
                    Sergeant: "I fuck you! Mosquito how big you how big, HUH?"
                    <br><br>
                    Diva: "I bigger sergeant..."
                    <br><br>
                    Sergeant: "Then why you scared? Mosquito also have a family right? They suck your blood to provide for their family right? You think it's right for us to deny them their livelihood?"
                    <br><br>
                    Whole section: "..."
                    <br><br>
                    Sergeant: "Nevermind! Everyone 20! Each time you do one push-up, I want you guys to say sorry mosquito, please suck my blood."
                    <br><br>
                    And we certainly did that, while laughing our asses off.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>BMT in a nutshell</strong><br>
                    BMT was one hell of a ride, there were no highs and only lows. However, I guess the things we did were interesting? From the route marches, the songs we had to sing during our route march,
                    the grenade throwing, the live firing, the Urban Ops, the field camp, and the mealtime regimes. Not forgetting to mention, the insanely late bookouts and early bookins we had because our company was located in School 4.
                    Unlike School 1 to 3 that are located right beside the ferry terminal, School 4 is located at the very heart of Pulau Tekong, which means we have to 
                    take a vehicle for each book in and book out, and that translated to abysmal book-in/out timings.
                    <br><br>
                    There was also the final 24km route march, which was shit in and of itself, but I guess it made me appreciate Singapore a little more. The POP parade was kinda lit though, I should have thrown my jockey cap higher and further away!

                    And we are on to the next phase of my NS journey, Specialist Cadet School (SCS)! Unfortunately, I wasn't good enough to go to Officer Cadet School (OCS), but oh well! No hard feelings!
                    <br><br>
                    SCS is a 6-months journey, where recruits will go first through foundation term for the first two months, learning basic infantry leader skills. They would then move on to the professional term,
                    where they would be assigned to the various vocations such as Signals, Military Police, Navy, Medic, etc. Finally after everything, everyone will come back together for 
                    combined arms term, where we would practice for our Specialist Cadet Graduation Parade (SCGP).
                    <br><br>
                    As per above, I no longer remember things in chronological order, so you guys get short stories instead. Teehee!
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Toilet IC Incident Again!</strong><br>
                    Before we get to the juicy bits, I was assigned to be the toilet IC officially this time. 
                    <br><br>
                    Just unlucky I guess.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The SAW Live Firing Incident</strong><br>
                    Every infantry section, comprising of 7 men, would carry weapon systems designed to tackle any obstacles that they encounter in battle. One of these weapon systems is the Section Automatic Weapon (SAW).
                    It is basically build like a light machine-gun, so when you hold down the trigger, the gun goes brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. The SAW is bulkier, longer and heavier than the SAR-21.
                    <br><br>
                    I do not enjoy handling the SAW because the charging handle always ends up poking my dick when I sling it. It's highly uncomfortable... 
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, each specialist cadet (SCT) had to clear SAW live firing as a veto to go to pro term. SAF treats live firing very seriously so movement of personnel during live firing is highly controlled. You want to go to the toilet?
                    Ask your encik. You want to refill water? Ask your encik. You want to eat food? Ask your encik. 
                    <br><br>
                    On this particular day, they didn't allow us to go to the toilet because it involved a very tedious process of checking the weapon for each indvidual. I, for one, am a huge fan of drinking water. On top of that,
                    SAF makes us love drinking water by asking us to half-bottle drink up every hour. As such, my bladder was nearing its capacity but I was not scheduled to do live firing until after multiple more details. Attempts to beg my trainer
                    to go to the toilet was rejected so the only option was to hold it in like a man.
                    <br><br>
                    For those who fired SAR-21, you would know how loud it is even with ear plugs on. You would also know the recoil when firing a bullet. Now you multiply that by about 3 times. You get the SAW. Not only is it 
                    fucking loud and definitely damaging to the eardrums, the recoil is insane because it is an automatic weapon compared to the SAR-21. In fact, I wonder how you even aim with the SAW, it definitely feels more like a spray-and-hope-it-hits-something 
                    kind of weapon to me.
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing could prepare me for the SAW live firing, not even the previous SAR-21 live firing that I had.
                    <br><br>
                    By the time it was my turn to do the live firing, my bladder was about to burst. 
                    <br><br>
                    No man should experience what I experienced that day.
                    <br><br>
                    Let's just say, when the firing command was given, the SAW wasn't the only thing that fired that day.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The CBRE Incident</strong><br>
                    Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosive Disposal (CBRE), one of the coolest specialisations in the SAF! Though only a few selected individuals are chosen for this vocation, all SCTs would have to undergo basic CBRE training during 
                    foundation term. This involved wearing the Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) equipment. Just imagine yourself decked out in another layer of protective suit from head to toe, from a suit, to boots, gloves and gas masks. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our training involved us being in the MOPP 4 outfit for 10 minutes, MOPP 4 being the highest level of protection against CBRE elements. Man was it hot, it was like being in a toaster, I felt like I was being cooked alive by the very thing 
                    I was wearing. When I finally got to take it off, though it was during the afternoon under the blazing hot sun, it legit felt like I just walked into an air-conditioned room.
                    <br><br>
                    Hats off to all the CBRE personnels, especially the guys, my god I don't know how you guys do it. Imagine your sperm getting cooked alive by your own body. Jesus.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Infantry Pro Term Incident</strong><br>
                    Foundation term ends off with a bang, the Sergeant Rocky Challenge (SRC). SCTs will go around Pasir Laba Camp overnight completing challenges that would cover everything that we have learnt during the foundation term. It was supposed to 
                    be a milestone for everyone of us, signalling the end of days where we wear jocky cap and the days where we finally get to wear our berets. But alas, this was also the day where everyone would find out about their vocation posting.
                    <br><br>
                    Since we were part of the 3 SIR mono-intake, dreams postings such as Military Police, CBRE, the Navy were already out of the question. The only possible vocation that we could go to were the vocations that 3 SIR needed, namely Recon,
                    Medic, Signals, Artillery and last but absolutely the least, Infantry.
                    <br><br>
                    From the get go, everyone's personal mission in foundation term was to escape infantry pro term. You might say recon is more tiring than infantry, but at least they get to do their own things during missions while wearing the jungle hat compared to the 
                    IQ-lowering helmet. Though medics have to carry the medic pack, their training was infintely more fun and relevant. Signals was of course the best posting since it involved a lot of studying and not a lot of outfields.
                    At that point, I didn't even know artillery was one of the options, but when I heard that they became BMT specs instead of being attached to 3 SIR, I would say this was also a god posting.
                    <br><br>
                    Everyone in my section would ask our trainer about our potential postings, and we would hypothesize on what were the factors that determined our vocation. At some point, there were rumours that only the best would be posted to infantry, so you bet your ass me and my buddy 
                    decided to do the bare minimum when it came to clearing our vetos. We didn't hit IPPT gold, we didn't step up to take any leadership position, so on and so forth. I still ended up getting B+ for my grading in the end lol.
                    <br><br>
                    Prior to the commencement of SRC, our encik started off by saying 
                    <br><br>
                    "Gentlemen, it has been a great pleasure having you guys for the past 8 weeks. However, today might be the last day I would see some of you. I say this with a heavy heart as I have recieved word that 26 out of the 59 of you would not be following me into the professional term.
                    Nevertheless, I wish all of you the best of luck in the vocations you are posted to."
                    <br><br>
                    My god, I was doing some next level quick maths in my head. What was 26 out of 59? What were the chances of posting out?
                    <br><br>
                    Oh boy oh boy oh boy! I was already imagining the good days ahead.
                    <br><br>
                    Fate decided to say "haha fuck you" that day.
                    <br><br>
                    As everyone stood in front of the WOspec building, you could see that a lot of effort was placed into welcoming the SCTs into infantry professional term. There were multiple fire cauldrons sitting atop steel poles that lined the red carpet. 
                    High ranking infantry enciks and officers were stationed at every length of the carpet.
                    <br><br>
                    They began reading off the names one by one.
                    <br><br>
                    "Josiah" "Yes Encik!"
                    <br><br>
                    "Sean" "Yes Encik!"
                    <br><br>
                    I was thinking to myself. Wait! Sean is from the section after me! That means I'm safe right! FUCK YES!
                    <br><br>
                    Fuck no.
                    <br><br>
                    "Yin Jian" "yes encik...."
                    <br><br>
                    And there I went, down the red carpet, shaking hands with the regulars and getting pats on the back. 
                    <br><br>
                    My soul left my body that day. All I could think about was just what did I do in my previous life to be so unlucky in this life.
                    <br><br>
                    There was a buffet catered for all the pro term infantry cadets, but the mood in the canteen was completely morbid. There were no smiles, there were no laughters, there were only sighs of acceptance. They tried to hype
                    us up by preparing a propoganda film but at that point, I don't think anyone was even listening. All thoughts were just on the dreadful days ahead.
                    <br><br>
                    It was a new low for me.
                    <br><br>
                    After a bittersweet parting with half of my section mates, we trudged from the Hotel coy line to the Golf coy line to mark the start of our Infantry Professional Term.

                    I have an explanation for my haircut. It was initially 4 by 2. However, I thought it was too long since this was right before we would go to Taiwan for a month. 
                    Hence, I asked my dad to cut it for me. I did not expect him to take the shaver and do an around-the-world 
                    on my head, which made me want to commit suicide. The haircut was unsalvageable at that point, I became a monk.
                    <br><br>
                    God-damn my forehead was so shiny for that period of time.

                    <strong>The Toilet IC Incident Again Again!</strong><br>
                    Once again, before we get to the juicy bits, I was assigned to be the toilet IC. AGAIN. AND AGAIN. MOTHEFUCBKJDBSAKFJBD.
                    <br><br>
                    At this point, I should include in my resume: Professional toilet cleaner, military standard guaranteed.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Tekong Assault Mission Incident</strong><br>
                    If you ask me, infantry has the most boring and tiring job in a war. 
                    <br><br>
                    You are too insignificant to make any realistic impact during a war because those are settled by the Air Force, Navy and long range 
                    weapon systems such as artillery. 
                    <br><br>
                    Your only job in the war is to march in after the whole land has been razed by bombardments, fight a dirty fight from trench to trench, and occupy said land.
                    And yet, the amount of load you have to carry is inhumane. I'm talking 20kg worth of load per person. It is truly a marvel how one can keep proning and recovering multiple times with that load.
                    If I had to do this in a real war, I might just prone once and lie forever in the same spot.
                    <br><br>
                    For those who don't know, a typical infantry assault mission goes like this. During the daylight hours, you would stay put in a certain area, being in stand-two position (basically guns out and look out for enemies trespassing).
                    After daylight hours, you would then start moving, before attacking the enemy at first light, when the sun just rises.
                    <br><br>
                    For those perceptive readers, you might wonder, wait Yin Jian, then when do you guys sleep?
                    <br><br>
                    That's the fun part. You don't.
                    <br><br>
                    From 9pm to 6am, you are walking towards your objective. From 6am to 8am, you are attacking your objective. From 8am onwards till 9pm, you are setting up defence around your objective, eating lunch and dinner. Theoretically, there's no time to sleep.
                    <br><br>
                    Realistically, many cadets end up falling asleep when we are doing stand-two. It's literally impossible not to. Imagine staring into blank space for 6 hours straight. Are we robots??? The trick is to get into the prone position and put your face at the scope of your rifle, and drift off to lalaland. Of course, the trainers caught wind of this 
                    and it got so bad to the point where they said if they catch anyone proning, it was straight away 3 extras 😂😂.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway back to the story! On this particular night walk, I was carrying the SAW. Ugh, I know! Since it was one of the first few attack missions, our encik would pause during certain periods of our night walk to allow us to rest. By convention,
                    during these pauses, since we are walking in file formation (essentially two straight lines), we would have to go into high alert and point our weapons to our flanks, to cover every possible direction of attack. During this particular pause,
                    our encik gave the specific instruction to rest, while also mentioning that we can sit down.
                    <br><br>
                    So, sit down I did.
                    <br><br>
                    I placed my SAW on the ground, with the bipod engaged. Then, a trainer came by.
                    <br><br>
                    "Eh, what the fuck are you doing"
                    <br><br>
                    "Resting sergeant, encik say can sit down"
                    <br><br>
                    "WHEN THE FUCK CAN YOU SIT DOWN DURING A MISSION. FUCKING CB"
                    <br><br>
                    "..."
                    <br><br>
                    Literally every cadet around me was sitting on the floor, the only difference was that they were carrying SAR-21s. Not wanting to argue, I complied.
                    I didn't want to do high alert with the SAW while high kneeling. For those who don't know, the SAW is much much longer than the SAR-21 and far heavier, not even buff guy can do high alert 
                    on a SAW for an extended period of time. The only available option left was to prone.
                    <br><br>
                    And prone I did.
                    <br><br>
                    Except I was just so unfortunate that in the direction of my prone, there was dense, shoulder-height vegetation.
                    <br><br>
                    "Fucking CB, you can see anything anot? You looking at plant roots is it?"
                    <br><br>
                    "Sorry sergeant"
                    <br><br>
                    And so I high kneeled, while doing high alert with SAW. At the cost of my knees and my arms.
                    <br><br>
                    Sigh. I never felt so wronged in my life.

                    I can't mention my SCS journey without bringing up my buddy who stuck with me through thick and thin, throughout found term and pro term. Ladies and gentlemen, this man was even more unlucky 
                    than me. 
                    <br><br>
                    Over the course of 6 months, he managed to rack up a record number of Stoppage-Of-Leave (SOL) and extras.
                    <br><br>
                    The first incident happened during found term. In SCS, we were instructed to lock our bunk doors every time we leave our bunks, and these keys were not allowed to kept on cadets overnight. As such,
                    everyone in the section took turns to draw the key early in the morning and return it at night. 
                    <br><br>
                    On this day, it was Kieran's turn to return the key. Little did he know that another cadet had visited the coy office earlier that night to return their bunk key too, but they were wearing slippers. 
                    The regular in charge was livid, but closed one eye, promising that the next person who came into the coy office in slippers would sign SOL. Unfortunately, this cadet did not go on and notify the whole platoon.
                    At no fault of his own, Kieran stepped into the coy office in slippers, and he got slapped with a 7 days SOL AHHAHAHA.
                    <br><br>
                    He did not go home that weekend.
                    <br><br>
                    The second incident happened when we were doing M203 live firing. For those who don't know, M203 is an attachment for the SAR-21 which allows the soldiers to fire grenades from the rifle. M203 live firing was a veto for clearing the 
                    foundation term. 
                    <br><br>
                    There were 3 bays for the live firing: Bay 1, Bay 2 and Bay 3. As such, only three cadets could fire at any given time. SAF takes live firing very seriously and they would not hesitate to charge people for discharging ammunition without command.
                    There are two types: Negligent Discharge (ND) and Accidental Discharge (AD). 
                    <br><br>
                    On this fine day, Kieran was part of a detail for M203 live firing. The fire command was given.
                    <br><br>
                    "Bay 1, fire!"
                    <br><br>
                    Except if you were looking carefully, you would see two grenades being launched at that command. One from bay 1, the other from bay 3.
                    <br><br>
                    "That's Kieran, isn't it"
                    <br><br>
                    I facepalmed so hard when I heard that.
                    <br><br>
                    When he came back, you could tell he was sweating bullets based on the way he looked. Man looked like he had seen a ghost in broad daylight. He was about to be slapped with 14 days SOL for ND.
                    <br><br>
                    Fortunately, the conducting officer was understanding and only asked for a hand-written explanation of what happened, before only giving 1 extra to Kieran. Nevertheless, I never laughed so hard in my life.
                    <br><br>
                    The last incident happened in Taiwan during the final RAI declaration that we would ever do in SCS. For those who don't know, RAI are expended blanks that we fire during training exercises. Though absolutely harmless by itself,
                    SAF is very strict about personnels keeping any form of ammunition, spent or unspent. As such, there would always be declarations done at the end of training exercises, where all the ammunition are surrendered and a thorough check 
                    of each individual is performed. Any ammo found at this point would be a chargeable offence, aka SOL.
                    <br><br>
                    On that day, funnily enough, the conducting body could not emphasise any harder on checking for any hidden ammo in our personal belongings. It was the last mission we would ever do before we graduate, why shoot yourself in the foot by getting charged now
                    and risk not graduating?
                    <br><br>
                    Fate had other plans for Kieran. When the trainer finished checking me and moved on to Kieran, I heard
                    <br><br>
                    "EH, WHAT IS THIS!"
                    <br><br>
                    Every pair of eyes turn around and saw the trainer holding an RAI, with Kieran's dumbfounded look staring at it too. Turns out, one sneaky RAI decided to hide itself in the recesses of his broken ammo pouch.
                    <br><br>
                    This can't be real, was what I thought. No one can be this unlucky at life. 
                    <br><br>
                    The running joke at that point was that Kieran was about to be slapped with such a long SOL that he would have to stay in camp and only get to go home after SCGP, which was a whole month after we returned from Taiwan 😂😂😂. 
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, the conducting body decided to chalk this incident up to pure unluckiness and only gave Kieran 1 extra.
                    <br><br>
                    Till this day, I can't even tell whether this was the luckiest man or the unluckiest man I've ever met.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Exercise Starlight</strong><br>
                    Aaaand the highlight of infantry pro term. Exercise Starlight! Also known as the Taiwan overseas exercise. This trip was the testament of all the skills that we have learnt during professional term, and also the trip where the trainers 
                    would identify the cadets who display extraordinary leadership skills. Everyone was looking forward to this trip because the terrain in Taiwan was a breath of fresh air compared to the dense, humid jungle of Singapore.
                    <br><br>
                    We had to do an insane amount of preperation for this trip.
                    <br><br>
                    Firstly, the terrain in Taiwan is extremely hilly, there are hills and mountains everywhere. To prepare us for this, we had to mimic climbing hills in Singapore. This was what I call the Staircase to Heaven exercise. Imagine carrying 20kg worth of load,
                    climbing 5 flights of stairs up and down 25 times. 
                    <br><br>
                    The end result? A broken back and a broken set of knees. 
                    <br><br>
                    This was also the first time where I had actually seen people "steam". This apparantly occurs when the body temperature gets so high you can actually
                    see the water evaporating from the body lol. Honestly quite the sight to behold.
                    <br><br>
                    We also had to do a 20km unguided navigation exercise (NAVEX) in Singapore to prepare for the uncontrolled NAVEX that we would do in Taiwan. Uncontrolled meaning there would be no trainer attached to us, we are basically thrown into the wild with only a map and 
                    a pre-determined amount of checkpoints, and we are supposed to go to all of them. For anyone who have never done a NAVEX, let's just say, it is not something a sane human should ever do. There was a reason why the GPS was invented, so we don't need to fucking use the 
                    map like we are in the Stone Age!!!! 
                    <br><br>
                    But alas, during times of war, you cannot depend on technology. 
                    <br><br>
                    I find it quite funny that when the conducting body plans for NAVEX, they would always project the amount of time taken to complete the exercise. No section ever completed
                    the NAVEX in the projected amount of time. Since the equipment given to us were outdated or faulty, the situation of "Hor-lan" (being lost), was an inevitability.
                    <br><br>
                    We flew at the end of August. 
                    <br><br>
                    It was a night flight and we arrived around 7am there. We were then hustled onto buses, which was another 5 hours trip to the countryside. We did eventually arrive in Heng Chun Camp during noon, and it was blazing hot. There were actually other Singapore 
                    units over there, most of them were from OCS.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm going to say it now. Heng Chun Camp is hands down the best SAF camp I've ever been to. The camp itself is extremely small, about the size of 5 buildings. However, the facilities inside were the bomb, particularly the cookhouse. SAF cookhouses are famous for 
                    their uninspired and repetitive meals. But not Heng Chun Camp! I'm not sure whether it's because the chefs there are locally employed, or the fact that the produce used there are straight from the farms surrounding the camp, or the fact that perhaps they spam so much oil into the dishes,
                    but the food there was honestly the best 
                    thing I've ever eaten. The dishes are honestly comparable to certain restuarants in Singapore. Imagine waking up everyday having an unlimited supply for milk tea, now that's the life! Literally everyone was going for second and third servings for every meal, do you ever see that in a Singapore 
                    camp?
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, the first 3 days were very slow as all we did were administrative work. Things like drawing equipment, waiting for our equipment to arrive from Singapore, settling training programme, so on and so forth. The cadets basically slept in 60 man bunks, and we got to use our phone for practically
                    the whole day. After this honeymoon period, it was just hell on earth. Phone confiscated, outfield after outfield, force prep after force prep.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Exercise Longstride</strong><br>
                    The dreaded 3D2N uncontrolled NAVEX in Taiwan. With 3 companies from SCS in Taiwan, we were split into two main groups: one group would be inserted at the south of training area and are supposed to navigate towards the north. The other group would be inserted in the north of the training area and are supposed to
                    navigate towards the south. In the center of the training area stretches the only remnant of civilisation, a road that spans for multiple kilometres. In the south of the training area, it was mostly farms (think rice paddy fields) and mountains. In the north of the training area, it was farms and shophouses. As a precaution,
                    each section was allowed to carry two phones, one with a SIM card, another without. The phone with the SIM card was to be sealed in tape and only used in emergencies. The other phone would be used to take pictures, as proof that we had visited the checkpoints that we were supposed to go to. 
                    <br><br>
                    Like any thinking soldier, we had an ace up our sleeves. Most sections had already co-ordinated the purchase of additional SIM cards to be brought along during this NAVEX exercise for GPS purposes. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our section, however, did not prepare any. We were cheapskates. Yet by some miraculous stroke of luck, our phone that had no SIM card apparantly still had access to GPS, which we obviously abused the hell out of.
                    <br><br>
                    Ironically, we still ended up being the second last section to finish the NAVEX, out of 28 sections. As we only returned on the night of the second day, morale was low as we did not had any time to recover before the next outfield.
                    <br><br>
                    That was about to change real quick when we arrived back in camp.
                    <br><br>
                    Entering the bunk, we saw an entire section facing the wall, for no apparant reason. News soon spread that this section was caught for cheating during the NAVEX exercise. They had used their additional SIM card for GPS but they had lost the SIM card ejector right before the endpoint,
                    and couldn't remove the SIM card anymore. I felt so bad for the person in charge of carrying the SIM card ejector. Imagine making your whole section go out of course because you lost a small piece of metal.
                    <br><br>
                    Another section was also caught for using their SIM card. This time around, it was not because they had lost the SIM card ejector. The trainer had apparantly validated all their checkpoints and was about to return the phone to the cadet when he realised that for some reason, WhatsApp had 
                    multiple unread messages. Now, how does one receive WhatsApp messages when there was not supposed to be any signal during outfield? Yup, that section also got fucked.
                    <br><br>
                    Guess we were not as smart as we thought we were.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Cemetary Incident</strong><br>
                    We had started the NAVEX with high hopes. We wanted to complete it in one day, or at the very least, in 2 days and one night. 
                    <br><br>
                    We soon realised this was a pipe dream. At the start of the NAVEX, we were in a dilemma, the map said that there was supposed to be a road here, but the GPS said that there wasn't. But our eyes did see a road, but a road that was so overrun by vegetation it might as well not have been a road.
                    <br><br>
                    We decided to trust our 20 year-old map rather than the GPS.
                    <br><br>
                    What ensued was 3 hours of bashing through dense vegetation and scaling down a near 80-degree steep mountain. Oh boy, it wasn't fun at all.
                    <br><br>
                    We had essentially wasted precious time doing something absolutely unnecessary.
                    <br><br>
                    The sun sets early in Taiwan, the land becomes pitch-dark by 6pm. At this point, we were only nearing the center of the training area, but we were lost in the maze of farms. Our section had decided to hunker down for the night, however, we were also having difficulties finding places
                    to sleep. The conducting body had explicitly said that they did not want to see any Singaporean soldiers sleeping beside the road, as it would be damaging towards the reputation of our army. They also explicitly said that we were not allowed to sleep in the fields of the farm. This limited our options to basically only one thing.
                    <br><br>
                    In the countryside of Taiwan lies an extensive amount of graves and tombstones. I'm talking 3 football-field sizes. They are accessible to the public and are found in abundance near the farms that we were lost at.
                    <br><br>
                    We had no choice. Our bodies were about to give up on us and we couldn't navigate in the pitch dark. 
                    <br><br>
                    The section was split over this decision. The more religious people absolutely hated the idea of it, while the people that were shag beyond belief just straight up started sleeping. In the end, since there was no better alternative, we decided to first apologise to all the tombstones that we 
                    were trespassing, said our prayers, and proceeded to knock out until day two.
                    <br><br>
                    Till this day, it was one of the scariest night I've ever been through. Imagine sleeping surrounded by hundreds of tombstones, all around the height of 1m. The thought of it still sends shivers down my spine. 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Mike Ridgeline Incident</strong><br>
                    Before the NAVEX mission, our trainers would also emphasize to us to look out for the Mike Ridgeline at the south of the training area. Once you find the Mike ridgeline, all you had to do was traverse along it and you would find yourself at the endpoint in no time.
                    <br><br>
                    Since our section started in the North,
                    this was valuable information for us. 
                    <br><br>
                    For those who don't know, a ridgeline is the path that connects adjacent hills together. If you were navigating in this region, the most optimal path would be to walk the ridgeline since it involved the least climbing and the height provided a good sensing of where you were.
                    <br><br>
                    We crossed the center road on the second day of the NAVEX exercise. After spending 5 hours trying to find the Mike ridgeline, we thought we found it. We then spent 1 hour climbing to the top of it. Imagine our elation when we saw a safety OUV at the summit, with our trainers beside it.
                    <br><br>
                    "Master! Did we do it? Is this the Mike Ridgeline?"
                    <br><br>
                    "I fuck you! The Mike Ridgeline is that one". He proceeded to point to an ever taller hill behind him.
                    <br><br>
                    If you looked closely enough that day, you would see the souls of 11 cadets leave their bodies at the exact moment that sentence was spoken.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The SAW Live Firing Incident 2.0</strong><br>
                    In Taiwan, we also had a platoon live firing exercise. I was once again assigned the SAW (I'm beginning to sense a pattern here). Since I was part of the task force, I was fortunate enough to not have to move with the whole platoon. Rather, all I had to do was to situate myself at the top of the hill,
                    and engage any incoming enemy reinforcements. The main attacking body of the platoon had to walk 2km before doing fire movement to engage the enemy. 
                    <br><br>
                    For god knows what reason, though there was a tyre in front of me, the trainer never allowed me to use it as a support for my SAW. He in fact insisted that I fire the SAW in high alert position. For those who have read up till this point, I won't bother elaborating on this, but long story short, it's a fucking
                    stupid idea.
                    <br><br>
                    Prior to the fire command, they had asked me to go into the high alert position. I held that position for 5 minutes, my arms were literally spaghetti at that point.
                    <br><br>
                    When the fire command did eventually come, I simply did not give a shit anymore. I just pressed the trigger and the SAW went brrrrrrrrrrr. 
                    Since the bipod was not engaged, the only thing assisting me in the recoil was myself, and I was squatting. In essense, there was no support at all. My SAW went from pointing straight to pointing to the sky 😂😂😂.
                    <br><br>
                    I swear I hit every target I was supposed to hit that day. 
                    <br><br>
                    The story doesn't even end there.
                    <br><br>
                    During the final declaration for ammunition, I almost shat my pants when I did a weapon inspection and found out one of the take down pins for my SAW was missing. This was straight up 14 days SOL if I was caught. Since we were leaving at that point, I had no time to go around searching.
                    Thankfully, when we were sending arms, no one paid particular attention to my SAW. Once it was returned to the armskote, it was not my problem anymore since I would claim plausible deniablity at that point.
                    <br><br>
                    Phew!

                <p class="main-text">
                    Exercise Starlight ends with Exercise Warrior, a 5D4N outfield mission comprising of 2 attack and 1 defence mission. For our platoon, we did both attack missions first, followed by the final defence mission.
                    <br><br>
                    There were so many memorable things that happened then.
                    <br><br>
                    I would always remember walking through the countryside of Taiwan in the wee hours, experiencing the chilling breeze and carrying the Matador for every mission. On the night before our defence mission, we actually got to sleep on an open hill,
                    while staring at the sky. My god was it beautiful. I believe the light pollution in Singapore is way too high to spot any stars in the sky at night. But in rural Taiwan where there is hardly any electricity, the sky was teeming with life. It certainly was surreal and magical, and this memory
                    will stay with me till the day I die.
                    <br><br>
                    But that was not the highlight of this exercise!
                    <br><br>
                    During the second which was also the final attack mission we would ever do in SCS, our platoon was tasked to capture a hill as an objective. Now this hill had an unique topography. It was about 100 metres high, and there was only one man-made path towards the top of the hill. All other possible path were 
                    filled with dense vegetation and near 70-degree slopes. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our encik, hoping to impress his superior, decide to come up with the most absurd assault mission ever. Our platoon had 3 sections. He would send one section to attack from the only road towards the summit. This section was essentially cannon fodder, they were sent to die. Another section would scale the flank of the hill,
                    and if successful, would ambush the enemy's GPMG (General Purpose Machine Gun) position, and essentially win the fight. My section, would scale the hill from the behind, and essentially create an attacks from all fronts.
                    <br><br>
                    Sounds like a grand plan right?
                    <br><br>
                    On paper of course. What transpired was definitely not according to plan.
                    <br><br>
                    5:00am. We had spent 9 hours walking though Mike ridgeline to get to our objective. Everyone was exhausted beyond belief. 
                    <br><br>
                    6:00am. Everyone was in position. My section spent one fucking hour climbing the steep hill and we were huddled in the dense vegetation, ready to sneak up on our enemies and claim a swift victory.
                    <br><br>
                    Encik (whispering): "Okay boys. Last chance. One times good one. We confirm win. Wen Loong (Section IC), you know what to do right?"
                    <br><br>
                    Wen Loong (whispering): "Yes encik"
                    <br><br>
                    Encik (whispering): "okay, go go go go go"
                    <br><br>
                    One by one, we were exiting the vegetation. 
                    <br><br>
                    Wen Loong was the first man, Daniel was the second man, I was the third man and the rest of the section was behind me.
                    <br><br>
                    Mind you, the vegetation was waist high, if we were to just squat and slowly creep forward, we would have won so easily. But for some reason which I cannot comprehend till this day, our section IC literally screamed at the top of his lungs
                    <br><br>
                    "Contacted! Contacted! Contacted!"
                    <br><br>
                    Fuck my life. There goes our element of surprise. Time to do fire movement.
                    <br><br>
                    What followed was 5 minutes of painstaking leap and bound towards the enemy. 
                    <br><br>
                    "DANIEL! CON WIRE, WHERE'S THE BANGOLORE???!!!"
                    <br><br>
                    Amidst the chaos, you see one lone man making a mad dash though the battlefield, carrying a tube of TNT on his back. He landed beside me.
                    <br><br>
                    "Where's Wen Loong?"
                    <br><br>
                    I pointed to the front.
                    <br><br>
                    "DANIEL WHERE ARE YOU??? I NEED YOU"
                    <br><br>
                    "COMING!"
                    <br><br>
                    For those who don't know, con wire refers to concertina wire, the metal wire with spikes that goes in circles and stretches for a long distance. There are two ways to overcome a concertina wire. By stealth, you can take a wire cutter and cut an opening for the rest of the section. 
                    By force, you would use a bangolore torpedo which is basically just a life-sized cigarette-shaped TNT that completely blows open the concertina wire. During our professional term, we were taught on how to use the bangolore. There were so many steps to it. First you had to remove the safety,
                    you had to arm it, you had to countdown and everyone had to take cover because the blast radius is insane. This all required at least 2 mins if you skip all safety regulations.
                    <br><br>
                    But nope. Not for Daniel that day. This man could not be bothered to give a shit.
                    <br><br>
                    From my position, it was like watching an action movie. I saw this small man brave through the gunfire, land in front of the concertina wire, unstrap the bangolore that he was slinging, throw the whole bangolore torpedo, carrier and all, onto the con wire. He didn't even bother with any of the procudures that we were taught such as removing the safety pin or igniting it. All he did was scream
                    <br><br>
                    "IGNITED" "BANGALORE EXPLODED" in a matter of one second.
                    <br><br>
                    If there was death by laughter, I would have died on that spot that day. To hell with all the training that we went through, doesn't matter that this was the final mission which was supposed to be our best mission. When a man is tired, he simply does not give a shit.
                    <br><br>
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, this is how capable our army is. If the bangalore was real, our whole section would have been wiped out by that blast radius.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, we went on to conquer the enemy because of our plot armour, and successfully captured the objective. When the umpire declared me dead halfway though, I couldn't have been more happy to lie down and take off my helmet while I watched the rest of my section continue the dogfight.
                    <br><br>
                    Oh man, it was so retarded back then.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Rest & Relaxation</strong><br>
                    After three weeks of intense outfields, we were done with training! Now, it's on to R&R. To be fair, the food in the cookhouse was actually better than whatever I ate on the famous night market of Taiwan.
                    I don't really have much to talk about this. We went from tourist attraction to tourist attraction. There was a trip to a theme park in between, though it was extremely underwhelming since it was a weekday and most 
                    of the rides were closed. I kind of regret no taking more pictures though. Sigh. Never again!

                    And with that, we've come to the end of Infantry pro term. An extremely tiring and ridiculous journey, but a journey that left me with memories that would last a lifetime. Oh man, I'm still smiling while writing this.
                    There were certainly times where I wanted to give up, where I wanted to just go out of course, but I'm glad I didn't.
                    <br><br>
                    After this point, we would go on to the combined arms term, where I got to reunite with all my foundation term friends who were posted to other vocations.
                    <br><br>
                    As per tradition, I shall end this section off with the Golf Company's slogan.
                    <br><br>           
                    Grit! Gallant! Glory!
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Unit Posting Incident</strong><br>
                    There came a time during combined arms term where the trainers revealed our unit postings. 
                    <br><br>
                    This was the key moment that decided your life for the rest of your NS journey. Will I end up in 3 SIR as dictacted by mono-intake? Or will Lady Lucky finally bless me with something right in my life for once?
                    <br><br>
                    Rumours had it that only half of our company was being sent back to 3 SIR. Upon hearing that, I had accepted my fate. My brother had served his time in 6 SIR as a spec too, it was highly likely I was going to walk a similar path.
                    <br><br>
                    During the revelation, the suspense was killing me. 
                    <br><br>
                    I remember the trainer reading off a list of about 15 names (my name wasn't included) and he paused. All eyes were on him, everyone thought these people were going back to 3 SIR.
                    <br><br>
                    "BMT"
                    <br><br>
                    The celebration was wild. Primal screams of joy were heard. But I couldn't be happy, this meant that I still had the chance to go back to 3 SIR.
                    <br><br>
                    ANYTHING, ANYTHING BUT 3 SIR. Just for this, I swore I would be religious.
                    <br><br>
                    The trainer then read off another list of about 10 names, and paused. He smiled.
                    <br><br>
                    "3 SIR"
                    <br><br>
                    OH MY GOD! I'M NOT PART OF IT! OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD! My heart was racing.
                    <br><br>
                    He then read my name alongside two other names.
                    <br><br>
                    "ITI"
                    <br><br>
                    Confusion all around. No one had any idea what ITI stands for. Turns out it meant Infantry Training Institute and it was considered one of the lesser known god posting.
                    <br><br>
                    I was a happy man.

                    I definitely won't forget the one week worth of intense parade rehearsals under the hot sun. I think I got a shade darker because of the amount of time I spent in the sun.
                    <br><br>
                    But I guess it was worth it! Will never forget the Specialist Roar and the beret throwing afterwards too!

                    <strong>SCS in a nutshell</strong><br>
                    If you ask me, is SCS worth it? I would say heck ya. The things you get to experience, the people you get to meet, and the pay you get afterwards is not something you will get to experience anywhere else in life.
                    <br><br>
                    Although disclaimer, experience does vary with the vocation that you were assigned and the unit you were posted to subsequently.
                    <br><br>
                    SCS left with some of the fondest memories from NS, and I will cherish them for life. 
                    <br><br>
                    Would I do it all over again? Fuck no. But was I glad I did it? Fuck yes.
