                <p class="sub-heading"><em>Year 1 & 2</em></p>
                <p class="main-text" id="year1-2">
                    I'm going to be honest. Year 1 and 2 wasn't the best for me. In fact, they were actually the worst years of my life.
                    <br><br>
                    Contrary to popular belief, I was actually a rather sociable individual back in primary school. Having changed 
                    primary schools twice in my life, I was always fortunate enough to have met people who I managed to click with
                    on the first day. But alas, this luck would not prevail when I went to River Valley High School.
                    <br><br>
                    Funnily enough, RVHS wasn't even my first choice. Having scored (257 + 2) for my PSLE, I was at the cut-off point
                    for HCI and NJC. My parents were hell-bent on me applying for these schools, while I was praying desperately not to
                    get in because none of my friends could apply to these schools. When I heard my then best friend said he would
                    be applying for RV, you bet your ass I applied for it too. 
                    <br><br>
                    We ended up not getting assigned to the same class.
                    <br><br>
                    On the first day, everyone was streamlined into their classes and was told to pair up with the person that 
                    was sitting beside them. While I saw everyone talking to each other like they've been friends for years,
                    I awaited in anticipation for mine.
                    I would say it was <strong> MOST</strong> unfortunate that I was paired with what turned out to be the 
                    'cool' kid of the class. I knew I was done for, the vibes were simply not there. What's worse? He told me
                    at the end of the day that he would be missing out on the whole orientation because of urgent family matters. I simply had
                    nothing to say...
                    <br><br>
                    Now I obviously didn't sit there and dwell in self-pity, I tried to make friends during orientation. There was a guy
                    who looked like he was from China and was rather eccentric, and he didn't seem to have a partner, so I decided maybe he
                    could be a friend. While turns out no, he turned out to be the most arrogant, elitist and condescending person I got to know
                    in a span of three days. Besides, he preferred to hang out with girls than guys anyways.
                    <br><br>
                    I was on an any% friend-making speedrun, and I failed utterly. With the conclusion of orientation, I didn't 
                    make any friendship beyond acquiantances with my classmates. 
                    <br><br>
                    It was just downhill from there for the next two years. From not getting invited to any outings or birthday parties, to
                    being bullied, there was really not much I could do. Sometimes, it felt better to be invisible. Any form of group work would strike fear in my heart
                    as I was once again reminded of my plight. I, in fact, always prayed that groups were assigned by my teachers rather 
                    that self-formed so that I could avoid the situation
                    where I had to go around quite literally begging to be grouped with one of the many already established cliques in class. 
                    Man, I really didn't get why the boys in my class were so political about friendship. Perhaps I was simply not cool enough.
                    Puberty and the desire to fit in is one hell of a drug huh!
                    <br><br>
                    Now, you may be wondering, Hey Yin Jian, what about your CCA? Did you not have any friends there? Well yes good sirs and madams, I did.
                    But I absolutely hated the CCA. For context, I was from Scouts. I remember that during orientation, we were led around school
                    to trial for all the different CCAs, but of course, due to the sheer number of CCAs available, our class only went to the CCAs
                    that the vocal majority were interested in (sports). Well, fun fact, I absolutely suck at sports. So I obviously didn't get in.
                    I did, however, went to trial for band and infocomm club by myself, but to no avail.
                    Couple weeks later, we were told to indicate our top 3 interests for CCA. I remember the walk of shame I had to do when our form 
                    teacher interrupted our class later in the day and called a handful of names, before bluntly explaining to us that the three CCAs that we 
                    indicated did not want us, and we had to select a uniformed group instead (which surprise surpirse! Had no selection process! For fuck's sake).
                    In a moment of insanity, I indicated Scouts as my first choice, and boy would I live to regret that decision.
                    <br><br>
                    For those who didn't know, Scouts had two key events every year: Job week and Donation draw.
                    <br><br>
                    Job week happens during the March holidays, where scouts would dress in their ugly-ass uniforms and go around Singapore knocking
                    on unsuspecting doors, essentially begging people to give us work to do (ranging from washing cars to cleaning toilets, literally
                    anything under the sun). We would then get paid, at the <em><strong>DISCRETION</strong></em> of the person. So in fact, you might not even get paid at all
                    if the person decided so. This event was supposedly done to teach scouts the value of hardwork and earning money. What I got out of it
                    was that Singaporeans love to exploit free labour. Our teacher-in-charge, whom obviously must have never been a scout in their life, decided
                    to set quotas for everyone of us. I'm not talking about small sums of $50 per person. I'm talking unrealistic goals.
                </p>
                    <ul class="main-text">
                        <li>Year 1: S$150</li>
                        <li>Year 2: S$200</li>
                        <li>Year 3: S$250</li>
                        <li>Year 4: S$300</li>
                    </ul>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Now, considering that the every scout in Singapore would be doing this in the same period of time, realistically speaking, the golden period
                    where the likelihood of a household is not visited by a scout would be the first weekend of March holidays. In essense, Job week ain't Job week,
                    it should be Job weekend instead. Because if you tried to continue during the weekdays of Job Week, you can kiss your ass goodbye when every household
                    would simply turn you away citing reasons of already being visited. 
                    <br><br>
                    With each household having about a 50% of donating $2 or more (maybe if you are cute they would donate more, I've seen my female friends get $50 before, three times in a row),
                    I hope I have conveyed the impossibility of these quotas. Of course, the seniors would often help the juniors to hit their quotas, often at the expense of their own.
                    But one can only get so much help. Often times, I would have to use my own money to top up just to hit the quota, ranging above $100. I do not know what what going through my
                    mind during this period, I must have really been scared of the teacher huh.
                    Oh did I mention, I absolutely fucking hated Job Week.
                    <br><br>
                    Donation draw, on the other hand, is a different beast. It occurs during the second half of the year, where scouts are given booklets of 10 lucky draw tickets,
                    each costing $2. Our teacher-in-charge, being consistent as ever, decided to set quotas for everyone of us. This time, everyone of us were tasked to sell 5 booklets
                    regardless of age. Of course, those with many friends, relatives and extended family members would find success in convicing them to buy the tickets. For someone like me,
                    whose friends are mostly scouts, and having no family members beyond my immediate family, I struggled to sell even one book. Because who in the fucking right mind will want
                    to buy this lucky draw ticket. 
                    <br><br>
                    Thinking back, this was quite literally a ponzi scheme. The teachers would often say that it was fine not to sell finish the booklets, acting
                    like forgiving angels but when it came time to collect, they would throw looks of utter disapproval and demand for valid reasons on why you couldn't do it,  
                    before shaming you by citing that since your peers can do it, so why can't you. 
                    <br><br>
                    Back then, I admit I was a pussy, so I shelled out my own money to buy the tickets. Year after year, I topped up the remaining amount with my own money, I felt
                    like the most charitable man in the world. Then came the third year, when the Scouts HQ, 'rationally' decided that they were going to increase the ticket price
                    from $2 to $3 (must have been from the overwhelming purchase volume!). I told myself that was it, I was already in financial ruin, I wasn't about to dedicate my
                    life savings to this god-forsaken cause. That year, I sold half a book and I proudly returned everything to my teacher.
                    <br><br>
                    Job week and Donation Draw also had another reason behind it: To raise funds for Singapore Scouts to fund their activities. Till this day, I firmly believe that 
                    it functions more like a crime syndicate rather than a worldwide youth movement.
                </p>
                <p class="sub-heading"><em>Year 3</em></p>
                <p class="main-text" id="year3">
                    And we are in Year 3. This year, I took the subject combination: Physics and Chemistry and the rest of the usual stuff. Being a science nerd, I wanted to take triple 
                    science but my GPA was way too low to take that, and hence I settled with physics over biology. Ironically, I always preferred biology over physics. In fact, I almost
                    failed physics at the end of year 2. However, the narrative then was that biology was meant for those who wanted to study Medicine in the future, and that taking physics
                    was the more practical choice. I should have followed my passion instead. Sigh. 
                    <br><br>
                    Though I did end up doing the best for physics for the rest of my years so I would just take this 
                    as a blessing in disguise.
                    <br><br>
                    Year 3 was also the year I met the first clique in RV: Club Donkey. Perhaps the rowdiest and most idiotic of boy cliques in our batch, I am still glad to have met them
                    because I finally felt like I belonged somewhere. The things we did were so wild that I cannot list them all out, and hence I shall give a shout out to my dear friend
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kaiming/featured">Kai Ming's YouTube channel</a> which recorded all the dumb shit that we did back then (I have since learnt after writing this blog that he has archived every
                    video, and so I will leave links to the private playlists instead: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy29Mav70eualVsKcQRqa34abPOz31Ylf">Year 3 & 4</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy29Mav70euZwPhc3KaOfrvx0Ebs9fQJ2">Year 5 & 6</a>).

                    Of course, what would Year 3 be without Vainglory. Till this day, I firmly believe this game was ahead of its time, and its fall from grace was such a shame.
                    Built to be a 3v3 MOBA game with a variety of heros, we were hooked. We poured countless hours into this game; during our recess/lunch breaks,
                    during lessons and even after school. We were addicted. I, for one, was so addicted because I had nothing to do that I grinded to the highest rank
                    in the game: <strong> Vainglorious</strong>. 
                    <br><br>
                    This game took our batch by storm and almost everyone was playing it, even girls. And with that came a certain level of respect
                    for those who managed to attend the coveted rank of strong Vainglorious. I believe only 4 people managed to get this rank in my batch. I was even scouted to go 
                    pro 😂😂, but I had to politely decline because I didn't see a future in it and my parents would beat me to death and disown me if I 
                    went through with that. On the other hand, one guy in our batch did decide to go pro, and subsequently
                    dropped out of school in Year 5 lol. Nothing but respect for his confidence and his willingness to take a leap of faith,
                    I believe he is now in the eSports consulting industry, quite impressive to be very honest.
                    <br><br>
                    Man, I was so proud of myself back then you could say my life peaked in year 3.
                    <br><br>
                    I vividly recall that towards the end of the year, our chinese teacher was collating back our papers to resolve any disputed marks. This was done over a long
                    weekend and the message was disseminated online. I had this one friend who was just so unfortunate to break his phone during this period, and hence was uncontactable and 
                    had to live under a rock. Obviously, when he came to class and clarified for his marks, our teacher was livid. My friend was indignant, rightfully so, as his 
                    circumstances should have warranted special consideration. But our teacher was having none of it. When my friend returned to his seat and muttered to himself, she got
                    so pissed she started screaming at the whole class, berating us for being ungrateful students for what she has done for us. This culminated in her exclaiming "谢谢3G!"
                    sarcastically and stomping out of our class. Mind you, this series of events happened in the first 5 mins of a class of an hour, and she didn't look like she was returning. 
                    Us, being opportunists, all dramatically turned towards each other and proclaimed...
                    <br><br>
                    "VG!"
                    <br><br> 
                </p>
                <p class="sub-heading"><em>Year 4</em></p>
                <p class="main-text" id="year4">
                    Year 4 wasn't really that exciting of a year per say, but it was nonetheless important. Our classes were once again shuffled around to accomodate to the different subject combinations, 
                    and Club Donkey was essentially chopped in half. It went on to grow from a close knit group of 9 to a supermassive group of 25. I believe it hit a critical mass and subsequently
                    imploded into various smaller factions, leaving me in Club Cheetah (I've got no fucking idea who came up with these names). 
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, this was also the year where I had the best tablemates in my life, and also the first time I actually liked someone! It was essentially three idiots at the back of the class laughing 24/7 at anything and everything.
                    Miraculously, although we were supposed to switch seating positions every term (3 months), our form teacher never really got to it. I remember waiting in apprehension before every form teacher period, praying so hard that we
                    wouldn't change the seating arrangement because I simply loved my tablemates. And I guess that wish really did come true, because our seating arrangement never changed for a full year!
                    Time has really made me forgotten about so many of the fun times I've had back then, now I really wished I had recorded down all those fun moments...

                    Year 4 was also the year we had CID (Construct, Integrate, Differentiate) module, where I participated in the physics module with Club Donkey. For the first half of the year, We had 
                    to built a Rude Goldberg Machine from scratch, using items such as cardboard and everyday household items. For those of you wondering what a Rude Goldberg machine is,
                    I urge you to think about the massive machine about Singapore Science Centre where the ball rolls around the whole device infinitely.

                <p class="main-text">
                    I would like to say that our project was an absolutely massive failure because at every single stage of our machine, we had to manually trigger the next step because the machine would never co-operate.
                    <br><br>
                    The second half of the year, we had to participate in the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition. We essentially had to build a toy model of an airplane which would be lauched using a slingshot-like
                    device provided by the organisers. Every other group was doing intensive research on aerodynamics, trying to emulate the modern day airplane design, doing multiple dry runs, making constant adjustments to optimise their plane.
                    Meanwhile, Us being Club Donkey, gave absolutely no shits about any physics-related concept and built our airplane based on how cool it looked. The other Club Donkey group gave even less shits, they built their airplane with a stick as a body, and a wooden board as the wings. This
                    frankenstein of a model was in fact a last-minute attempt to salvage an irreperable plane and was conceptualised and made 2 days prior to the competition. 
                    <br><br>
                    Context: We had 3 months to prepare for this. 
                    <br><br>
                    On that day itself,
                    guess who did the best during the competition. The plane, with a fucking straw as a body 😂😂😂. My group's plane did a backflip and ended up behind the starting line, while all the other groups' plane never came close to
                    the beast of a straw plane. 
                    <br><br>
                    Now, what exactly is the lesson to be learnt here kids?
                    <br><br>
                    Work smart, not hard.

                    RVHS may have been a bubble that insulated us from all the drama and wild gossips from other schools, and it may have left us ill-prepared for
                    the outside world. But the way I see it, it was truly a blessing in disguise. Nowhere else will you find such pure and wholesome people who are genuinely
                    so kind and loving.

                    To the one that sat beside me in Year 4, the one where our friendship mysteriously fell apart, and the one who made the effort to reconnect
                    after two years, thank you from the bottom of my heart. You were part of some of my happiest memories from RVHS. Once every few months, I still think about you. 
                    <br><br>
                    I was never able to confess to you back then. 
                    Was it my ego? My pride? My fear of rejection? Perhaps it was all of them. But today, I will proudly say, I think you were one of the best person
                    I've ever met and I really liked you a lot back then. It was such a shame things turned out the way it did, with no proper closure and everything.
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps if circumstances were different, if I was much more mature, if I wasn't so stupid and ignorant, we could still have remained as friends, close friends even.
                    <br><br>
                    But I sow what I reap, and live with it I must.   
                    <br><br>
                    Fellow reader, I believe you are extremely weirded out and probably disgusted after having read a random stranger confess to no one, on the Internet at that. But I really had to get it
                    off my chest.
                    With that said,
                    cheers to the ones that are still here today, cheers to the one that I lost on the way, you were all an integral part of who I am today.
                    Though we may not stay in contact anymore, I still think all of you, and I reminisce about all the great times we had.
