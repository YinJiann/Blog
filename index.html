    <h1>Welcome to My Blog!</h1>
    <p>This is where I emotionally dump everything that has happened in my life so that it would never be forgotten.
        I was never a big fan of social media because of how it made me realise my life was boring. Well, this is the perfect solution! I can share about
        my life without ever having to compare with other! A win-win I would say!

    <p>Hey fellow stranger on the Internet! Take a look around, who knows, you might find something interesting/helpful!</p>
