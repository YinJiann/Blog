                <p class="main-text" id="year1">
                    I'm going to be honest. Year 1 and 2 weren't the best for me. In fact, they were actually the worst years of my life.
                    <br><br>
                    Contrary to popular belief, I was actually a rather sociable individual back in primary school. Having changed 
                    primary schools twice in my life, I was always fortunate enough to have met people who I managed to click with
                    on the first day. But alas, this luck would not prevail when I went to River Valley High School.
                    <br><br>
                    Funnily enough, RVHS wasn't even my first choice. Having scored (257 + 2) for my PSLE, I was at the cut-off point
                    for HCI and NJC. My parents were hell-bent on me applying for these schools, while I was praying desperately not to
                    get in because none of my friends could apply to these schools. When I heard my then best friend said he would
                    be applying for RV, you bet your ass I applied for it too. 
                    <br><br>
                    We ended up not getting assigned to the same class.
                    <br><br>
                    On the first day, everyone was streamlined into their classes and was told to pair up with the person that 
                    was sitting beside them. While I saw everyone talking to each other like they've been friends for years,
                    I awaited in anticipation for mine.
                    I would say it was <strong> MOST</strong> unfortunate that I was paired with what turned out to be the 
                    'cool' kid of the class. I knew I was done for, the vibes were simply not there. What's worse? He told me
                    at the end of the day that he would be missing out on the whole orientation because of urgent family matters. I simply had
                    nothing to say...
                    <br><br>
                    Now I obviously didn't sit there and dwell in self-pity, I tried to make friends during orientation. There was a guy
                    who looked like he was from China and was rather eccentric, and he didn't seem to have a partner, so I decided maybe he
                    could be a friend. While turns out no, he turned out to be the most arrogant, elitist and condescending person I got to know
                    in a span of three days. Besides, he preferred to hang out with girls than guys anyways.
                    <br><br>
                    I was on an any% friend-making speedrun, and I failed utterly. With the conclusion of orientation, I didn't 
                    make any friendship beyond acquiantances with my classmates. 
                    <br><br>
                    It was just downhill from there for the next two years. From not getting invited to any outings or birthday parties, to
                    being bullied, there was really not much I could do. Sometimes, it felt better to be invisible. Any form of group work would strike fear in my heart
                    as I was once again reminded of my plight. I, in fact, always prayed that groups were assigned by my teachers rather 
                    that self-formed so that I could avoid the situation
                    where I had to go around quite literally begging to be grouped with one of the many already established cliques in class. 
                    <br><br>
                    Man, I really didn't get why the boys in my class were so political about friendship. Perhaps I was simply not cool enough.
                    Puberty and the desire to fit in is one hell of a drug huh!
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p class="sub-heading"><em>Year 2</em></p>
                <p class="main-text" id="year2">
                    Year 2 was also the year I discovered I had no affinity for cooking. Come to think of it, I find it ironic that the Singapore education system deems home econs as a necessary
                    subject for students to take yet they do not offer further support in higher education, unless the individual chooses to pursue it in ITEs/Polytechnics. 
                    Anyway, RV had two home econs teachers, one was rumoured to be a caring, nuturing and motherly figure, while the other one was rumoured to be a ruthless bitch.
                    Guess who I got?
                    <br><br>
                    From day one, I was already one of the few individuals singled out for special attention, and I didn't even know what I did wrong. I know that I was slow to
                    pick up on the different cooking utensils and procedures but what the hell woman, have you not heard of the virtue: patience. I went from being partnered with a guy to being partnered
                    with a girl, and specifically told to do whatever the girl tells me to do. I ended up rotating through three different girls. 
                    <br><br>
                    I believe I was quite an enigma to my teacher because halfway
                    through the year, she brought me aside to speak to me privately. She then, for the first time in my life, expressed concern and asked whether I came from an abusive family (which explains why I'm so quiet). What the actual fuck.
                    I, of course, wanted to laugh on the spot but had to keep a straight face and instead played along with the narrative. From then on, she became less strict with me.
                    <br><br>
                    RVHS also had an Overseas Exchange Learning Programme (OELP) during year 2 where each class gets to visit a sister school in China to experience their culture. My class was selected 
                    to go to Shang Hai/Su Zhou. To be honest, I don't really remember much about the time spent in our sister school other than the fact that I had no idea what was happening in class
                    because they conversed in chinese. Their cafeteria, however, was quite lit. It functioned much like what you see in American shows, where students line up in a row to collect food from 
                    the main kitchen. 
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, that's besides the point. The reason why I brought up this was an incident that occurred when we were at a tourist attraction. Since I had no friends, I was basically going around by myself,
                    and a Rubik's Cube caught my attention. Just as I was about to express interest in purchasing it, a voice behind me said that they also wanted one. Confused, I turned around. Lo and behold, it was
                    Reuben. Now I'm sure all of you don't know who Rueben is, well he had no friends like me, but worse. This insufferable twat was hated by the entire class for his actions and personality. He would continue to be hated by
                    all his classmates until he dropped out of school in Year 5. This little shitter was actually tagging along beside me for the whole day even though I didn't want his company.
                    Since there was only one Rubik's Cube on display and he verbalised his order first, the Rubik's Cube was rightfully his.
                    <br><br>
                    If things ended at that point, I would have gotten over it, but nope. The store owner noticed my discontent, and mentioned that there were more in stock, before taking another Rubik's Cube
                    out from storage. Reuben, then proceeded to say he didn't want the Rubik's cube that was just sold to him, but rather the one from the new package, and that I could have the one that was previously on display. The
                    audacity of this bitch!!! Typing this actually makes my blood boil till this day. Wanting no part of this drama, the store owner just handed it to him and sold the other one to me.
                    <br><br>
                    From that day on, it was a cold war between me and Reuben.

                <p class="main-text" id="CCA">
                    Now at this point, you may be wondering, wait Yin Jian, what about your CCA? Did you not have any friends there? 
                    <br><br>
                    Well yes good sirs and madams, I did.
                    But I absolutely hated the CCA. For context, I was from Scouts. I remember that during orientation, we were led around school
                    to trial for all the different CCAs, but of course, due to the sheer number of CCAs available, our class only went to the CCAs
                    that the vocal majority were interested in (sports). Well, fun fact, I absolutely suck at sports. So I obviously didn't get in.
                    I did, however, went to trial for band and infocomm club by myself, but to no avail.
                    Couple weeks later, we were told to indicate our top 3 interests for CCA. I remember the crushing shame when our form 
                    teacher interrupted our class later in the day and called a handful of names, before bluntly explaining to us that the three CCAs that we 
                    indicated did not want us, and we had to select a uniformed group instead (which surprise surpirse! Had no selection process! For fuck's sake).
                    In a moment of insanity, I indicated Scouts as my first choice, and boy would I live to regret that decision.
                    <br><br>
                    For those who didn't know, Scouts had two key events every year: Job week and Donation draw.
                    <br><br>
                    Job week happens during the March holidays, where scouts would dress in their ugly-ass uniforms and go around Singapore knocking
                    on unsuspecting doors, essentially begging people to give us work to do (ranging from washing cars to cleaning toilets, literally
                    anything under the sun). We would then get paid, at their <em><strong>DISCRETION</strong></em>. So in fact, you might not even get paid at all
                    if the person decided so. 
                    <br><br>
                    This event was supposedly done to teach scouts the value of hardwork and earning money. What I got out of it
                    was that Singaporeans love to exploit free labour.
                    <br><br>
                    Our teacher-in-charge, whom obviously must have never been a scout in their life, decided
                    to set quotas for everyone. I'm not talking about small sums of $50 per person. I'm talking unrealistic goals.
                </p>
                    <ul class="main-text">
                        <li>Year 1: S$150</li>
                        <li>Year 2: S$200</li>
                        <li>Year 3: S$250</li>
                        <li>Year 4: S$300</li>
                    </ul>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Now, considering that the every scout in Singapore would be doing this in the same period of time, realistically speaking, the golden period
                    where the likelihood of a household being not visited by a scout would be the first weekend of March holidays. In essense, Job week ain't Job week,
                    it's Job weekend instead. Because if you tried to continue during the weekdays of Job Week, you can kiss your ass goodbye when every household
                    would simply turn you away citing reasons of already being visited. 
                    <br><br>
                    With each household having about a 50% of donating $2 or more (maybe if you are cute they would donate more, I've seen my female friends get $50 before, three times in a row),
                    I hope I have conveyed the impossibility of these quotas. Of course, the seniors would help the juniors to hit their quotas, often at the expense of their own.
                    But one can only get so much help. Often times, I remember topping up with my own money just to hit the quota. I do not know what was going through my
                    mind during this period, I must have really been scared of the teachers' disapproval huh.
                    <br><br>
                    Oh did I mention, I absolutely fucking hated Job Week.
                    <br><br>
                    Donation draw, on the other hand, is a different beast. It occurs during the second half of the year, where scouts are given booklets of 10 lucky draw tickets,
                    each costing $2. Our teacher-in-charge, being consistent as ever, decided to set quotas for everyone. This time, everyone was tasked to sell 5 booklets
                    regardless of age. Of course, those with many friends, relatives and extended family members would find relative success in selling the tickets. For someone like me,
                    whose friends were mostly students, and having no family members beyond my immediate family in Singapore, I struggled to sell even one book. Because who in the fucking right mind will 
                    spend their pocket money to buy this pseudo-lottery ticket.
                    <br><br>
                    Thinking back, this was quite literally a ponzi scheme. The teachers would often say that it was perfectly fine not to finish selling the booklets, acting
                    like benevolent angels but when it came time to collect, they would throw looks of utter disapproval and demand for valid reasons on why you couldn't do it,  
                    before shaming you by citing that since your peers can do it, why can't you. 
                    <br><br>
                    Back then, I admit I was a pussy, so I shelled out my own money to buy the tickets. Year after year, I topped up the remaining amount with my own money, I felt
                    like the most charitable man in the world. Then came the third year, when the Scouts HQ, 'rationally' decided that they were going to increase the ticket price
                    from $2 to $3 (must have been from the overwhelming purchase volume!). I told myself that was it, I was already in financial ruin, I wasn't about to dedicate my
                    life savings to this god-forsaken cause. That year, I sold half a book and I proudly returned everything to my teacher.
                    <br><br>
                    Job week and Donation Draw also had another reason behind it: To raise funds for Singapore Scouts to fund their activities. Till this day, I firmly believe that 
                    it functions more like a crime syndicate rather than a worldwide youth movement.
                    <br><br>
                    Apart from this, normal CCA sessions were also filled with dreadful tasks. Most notably, pioneering.
                    <br><br>
                    For those who are unaware, pioneering involves using ropes and wooden spars of varying length to build large wooden structures. Very much like you are thrown
                    into the Stone Age. I remember being so mesmerised by the beauty of these structures until I had to start building one. 
                    <br><br>
                    Holy fuck is it boring and tedious.
                    <br><br>
                    First, you spend multiple CCA sessions perfecting your common knots such as square leashing and diagonal leashing where they time you and test the strength of your knot.
                    Quick tip: You would never pass because they can't have you being complacent. Second, you actually start to build multiple components of the final structure. To be quite 
                    honest, we never really got past this stage. Reason being that we always took so long to complete the components that CCA sessions would end before we actually 
                    could put the whole structure together. And the worst thing, we were building the very same structure for 4 years: the god-damn watchtower. God forbid our teachers/seniors be creative
                    and teach us anything else.
                    <br><br>
                    When we become seniors, the planning committee decided to change the curriculum.

                    There was also outdoor cooking! No, I'm not talking about using charcoal or firestarters. I'm talking backwoodsman cooking, where you are of course yet again thrown back into the 
                    Stone Age. Till this day, I still remember the different degrees of firewood.

                <ul class="main-text">
                    <li>First Degree: The most flammable, the type you use to start fires. The only example: Coconut husks.</li>
                    <li>Second Degree: The transitioning firewood, the type that bridges the gap between starting a fire and maintaining a fire. Examples: Thin twigs.</li>
                    <li>Third Degree: The good shit, the type that burns forever. Example: Logs.</li>

                <p class="main-text">
                    Fun fact: Leaves are the absolute worst firewood and they choke the living life out of you when they burn.

                    Anyway, back to our cavemen experience.
                    We would use axes to dig a square pie out of the soil in order to start our fire, before cooking food in our mess tins. 
                    Each outdoor cooking session was filled with naive dreams of eating good food, and hence you would see people bringing rice, vegetable, eggs and even chicken! 
                    <br><br> 
                    Reality is often disappointing so each time, we settled with rice kernels, vegetables drowned in oyster sauce, semi-cooked eggs, and chicken so raw it might as well have came straight from the farm.
                    <br><br>
                    When we finally did decide to use the BBQ pit for once in 6 years, look at the difference in outcome!

                    <br><br>
                    Last but not least, I will not fail to mention to amount of corporal punishments that we had to do in this CCA. Literally every CCA session, you will end up doing punishments equivalent to 60 push-ups.
                    Move in file? Push-up. Fail to meet an impossible timing? Push-up. Somebody else fuck up? Push-up. Some seniors even bait the juniors by telling them that their shoelaces are untied, only for them to look down
                    and be considered moving in file. And hence, push-up.

                <p class="main-text" id="year3">
                    And we are in Year 3. This year, I took the subject combination: Physics and Chemistry and the rest of the usual stuff. Being a science nerd, I wanted to take triple 
                    science but my GPA was way too low for that, and hence I settled with physics over biology. Ironically, I always preferred biology over physics. In fact, I almost
                    failed physics at the end of year 2. However, the narrative then was that biology was meant for those who wanted to study Medicine in the future, and that taking physics
                    was the more practical choice. 
                    <br><br>
                    I should have followed my passion instead. Sigh. 
                    <br><br>
                    Though I did end up doing the best for physics for the rest of my years so I would just take this

                    because I finally felt like I belonged somewhere. The things we did were so wild that I cannot list them all out, and hence I shall give a shout out to my dear friend

                    RVHS also held an annual event called Ylead, where they invited students from multiple schools in Singapore and overseas for some sort of leadership and social connection camp. It was 5D4N,
                    and every senior would hype it up so much, claiming it was the best event that they attended in their life. There was even a tradition to post on Instagram on the week after, with the caption being post ylead blues. My god it was cringe.
                    <br><br>
                    I, however, felt it was as unmemorable as it could get. Reuben was in my group. Just look at my face.

                    As a celebration for the end of Ylead, there was a commencement night where everyone would dress up in smart casual and guys would ask their 
                    girlfriend/female friends for a hand in the dance segment. I remember every single guy stressing out about not having a dance partner,
                    because at that point, that was a big deal. I would say this event led to the revelation of a few couples and the heart-breaking rejection of many more individuals.
                    <br><br>
                    As for me, I hated every minute of that. If anything, this event made me acutely aware that I had no fashion sense. I was in fact so ashamed of what I wore I could not wait for the night to end and take the bus home.

                    Of course, what would Year 3 be without Vainglory. Till this day, I firmly believe this game was ahead of its time, and its fall from grace was such a shame.
                    Built to be a 3v3 MOBA game, our whole class was hooked. We poured countless hours into this game; during recess/lunch breaks,
                    during lessons and even after school. We were addicted. I, for one, was so addicted because I had nothing to do that I grinded to the highest rank
                    in the game: <strong> Vainglorious</strong>. 
                    <br><br>
                    This game took our batch by storm and almost everyone was playing it, even girls. And with that came a certain level of respect
                    for those who managed to attain the coveted rank of Vainglorious. I believe only 4 people managed to get this rank in my batch. I was even scouted to go 
                    pro 😂😂, but I had to politely decline because I didn't see a future in it and my parents would have beaten me to death and disowned me if I 
                    went through with that. On the other hand, one guy in our batch did decide to go pro, and subsequently
                    dropped out of school in Year 5 lol. Nothing but respect for his confidence and his willingness to take a leap of faith,
                    I believe he is now in the eSports consulting industry, quite impressive to be very honest.
                    <br><br>
                    Man, I was so proud of myself back then you could say my life peaked in year 3.
                    <br><br>
                    I vividly recall that towards the end of the year, our chinese teacher was collating back our papers to resolve any disputed marks. This was done over a long
                    weekend and the message was disseminated online. I had this one friend who was just so unfortunate to break his phone during this period, and hence was uncontactable and 
                    had to live under a rock. Obviously, when he came to class and clarified for his marks, our teacher was livid. My friend was equally indignant, rightfully so, as his 
                    circumstances should have warranted special consideration. But our teacher was having none of it. When my friend returned to his seat and muttered to himself, she got
                    so pissed she started screaming at the whole class, berating us for being ungrateful students for what she has done for us. This culminated in her exclaiming "谢谢3G!"
                    sarcastically and stomping out of our class. 
                    <br><br>
                    Mind you, this series of events happened in the first 5 mins of an hour's class, and she didn't look like she was returning. 
                    After the initial awkward silence, someone screamed ...
                    <br><br>
                    "VG!"
                    <br><br>

                    Year 4 wasn't really that exciting of a year per say, but it was nonetheless important. Our classes were once again shuffled around to accomodate to the different subject combinations, 
                    and Club Donkey was essentially chopped in half. It went on to grow from a close knit group of 9 to a supermassive group of 25. I believe it hit a critical mass and subsequently
                    imploded into various smaller factions, leaving me in Club Cheetah (I've got no fucking idea who came up with these names). 
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, this was also the year where I had the best tablemates in my life! It was essentially three idiots at the back of the class laughing 24/7 at anything and everything.
                    Miraculously, although we were supposed to switch seating positions every term (3 months), our form teacher never really got to it. I remember waiting in apprehension before every form teacher period, praying so hard that we
                    wouldn't change the seating arrangement because I simply loved my tablemates. And I guess that wish really did come true, because our seating arrangement never changed for a full year!
                    Time has really made me forgotten about so many of the fun times I've had back then, now I really wished I had recorded down all those priceless moments...
                    <br><br>
                    Year 4 was also the year we had CID (Construct, Integrate, Differentiate) subject, where I participated in the physics module with Club Donkey. For the first half of the year, we had 
                    to built a Rude Goldberg Machine from scratch, using items such as cardboard and everyday household items. For those of you wondering what a Rude Goldberg machine is,
                    I urge you to think about the massive machine at the entrance of the Singapore Science Centre where the ball rolls around the whole device indefinitely.

                <p class="main-text">
                    I would like to say that our project was an absolutely massive failure because at every single stage of our machine, we had to manually trigger the next step because the machine would never co-operate.
                    <br><br>
                    The second half of the year, we had to participate in the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition. We essentially had to build a toy model of an airplane which would be lauched using a slingshot-like
                    device provided by the organisers. Every other group was doing intensive research on aerodynamics, trying to emulate the modern day airplane design, doing multiple dry runs, making constant adjustments to optimise their plane.
                    Meanwhile, us being Club Donkey, gave absolutely no shits about any physics-related concept and built our airplane based on how cool it looked. The other Club Donkey group gave even less shits, they built their airplane with a stick as a body, and a wooden board as the wings. This
                    frankenstein of a model was in fact a last-minute attempt to salvage an irreperable plane and was conceptualised and made 2 days prior to the competition. 
                    <br><br>
                    Context: We had 3 months to prepare for this. 
                    <br><br>
                    On that day itself,
                    guess who did the best during the competition?
                    <br><br>
                    The plane with a fucking straw as a body 😂😂😂. My group's plane did a backflip and ended up behind the starting line, while all the other groups' plane never came close to
                    the beast of a straw plane. 
                    <br><br>
                    Now, what exactly is the lesson to be learnt here kids?

                    Not going to lie, when the class list was first released, my heart sank. I knew absolutely no one apart from two people, and I had no expectations at all.
                    <br><br>
                    In fact, the 6J boys reached a tacit agreement that we all experienced two disappointments during the class list release day. First, when they realised there 
                    were no pretty girls in the class. Second, when they realised that they did not recognise the other guys in the class.

                    Now to all my readers, this sounds like just another common occurence. Just knock on the door, explain to the teacher using our home room, retrieve the whiteboard, and exit.

                    Little did I know that the very teacher occupying my homeroom was Ms Chang, a notorious chemistry teacher known to be extremely strict with her students. So here I am, knocking on the door,
                    sincerely apologising for disturbing, and asking to retrieve the whiteboard. 
                    <br><br>
                    "No. Your fault for forgetting. Not my problem. Go back." 
                    <br><br>
                    "????"
                    <br><br>
                    I was fuming. I went back to my class, completely black-face. I explained the situation to our teacher, who then told me that we needed the whiteboard to proceed with the lesson. I was stuck between 
                    a rock and a hard place. At this moment, our beacon of righteousness, Joshua, decided to rile up the boys and demanded for justice. No one, not even Ms Chang, was going to impede our learning process.
                    And so, all the boys marched out of the classroom, ready for war. There were calls to raid our homeroom with aggression and exit in style. 
                    When we reached our homeroom, it soon became apparant that the previous gung-ho energy was all for show, and that we had no concrete plan at all. In fact, everyone pussied out 😂.
                    <br><br>
                    What ensued was 15 minutes of back and forth strategic planning, with the final plan being storming through the backdoor, grabbing the whiteboard, and running for our lives. Now who was taking the whiteboard and leading the charge?
                    Yours truly.
                    <br><br>
                    And I certainly did.
                    <br><br>
                    Except when I opened the door, no one came in with me. I took a look outside the classroom window and I saw 9 heads making a mad dash back to our econs classroom, all while squatting below the window level to avoid
                    being seen.
                    <br><br>
                    That very day, I lost hope in humanity.
                    <br><br>
                    Long story short, I got fucked by Ms Chang and humiliated in front of an entire class. I then did a walk of shame back to my classroom, pissed beyond belief.

                    Year 5 was also the year we took Project Work, the one subject where your grade was decided by a Russian Roulette, you either get a good mentor and hence a good grade, or you are screwed.
                    <br><br>
                    Our class hit jackpot.
                    <br><br>
                    Face to face, our mentor would be encouraging and says she likes all our ideas. But behind our backs, she would rant to her colleagues (our GP teacher) that our class was lazy and that she was working overtime for us. 
                    Yet, you see her cafe hopping on Instagram almost daily and playing Candy Crush while groups were doing presentation. There was even a google docs which had a compilation of her unprofessional conduct.
                    <br><br>
                    Towards the end, our class resorted to consulting other mentors, which turned out to be a great idea because we all got A in the end, no thanks to her.
                    <br><br>
                    RVHS PE teachers also decided to make the end of Year 5 end with a bang for guys, and so we were forced to go for a compulsory 3D2N All Boys Camp. There, we were trained in the fieldcrafts of a soldier,
                    putting on camo, sleeping in uncomfortable positions and subjected to regimentation. On the last night, they got all the guys to line up on the road in underwear, before making us powder bath as a sign 
                    of camaraderie. I swear it was the most toxic form of masculinity I've ever experienced up till then and I'm sure as hell it was illegal.
                    <br><br>
                    But it did leave a lasting impression to the point where this became a common occurence in school for a period of time.

                    And we've finally come to Year 6! Unfortunately, there really isn't much to talk about this year. Everyone was all so caught up with preparing for A levels but I still think we had so much fun.
                    I'll always remember the days from July to October where everyone stayed back in school after lessons and basically pitched a tent in the library and studied all night till 9pm. Though studying for such long periods
                    of time was borderline insanity, doing it with each and everyone one of you made it tolerable. 
                    <br><br>
                    Well, I shall stop talking about A levels! Because who likes to listen about studying!
                    <br><br>
                    Fast forward a few months, and it finally came for us to graduate!

                    Just look at our faces! Oh man, I miss those times.
                    <br><br>
                    When the day for A level results came, you have no idea how heartwarming it was to see all the guys do so well and everyone going up on stage. For the record, 7/10 of 6J guys got 90 rank points! While the remaining 3 got 88.75!
                    <br><br>
                    We truly were one of a kind
                    huh.

                    Before I conclude this year, how could I not mention about prom!
                    <br><br>
                    Towards the end of prom, there was a vote for Prom King and Prom Queen. However, it involved people submitting the names of the couple in a google form first, to determine which couples would be in contest. 
                    <br><br>
                    Now, who wants to just see the most popular couple win right? Where is the fun in that? 
                    <br><br>
                    Club Donkey decided to spice things up by mass submitting the most troll pairing of individuals: Ze Han and Bo Wei. 
                    For context, these two individuals had no where near a faction of the 
                    popularity of the legitimate couples. This idea then spreaded like wildfire and this non-existent couple
                    actually made it into the finals. 
                    <br><br>
                    The final 3 couples were then told to do a catwalk down the middle of the hall, which I assume was tradition and meant to garner support. Below is a clip of the sabo-ed duo's turn.

                    Imagine our surprise when Ze Han princess-carried Bo Wei, a girl that is not even his girlfriend, and paraded her up and down the hall. What in the world😂😂. I guess the crowd really got to him. Club Donkey will take 
                    all credit for this amazing turn of events. 
                    <br><br>
                    Guess who won in the end?

                <p class="main-text">
                    Our match made in heaven! One can never forget the bitter looks on the other couples' faces when they lost to an illegitimate couple. 
                    <br><br>
                    You can watch both these videos a million times and each time you will spot something even more stupid HAHAHA.
                    <br><br>
                    Let it be set in stone that Club Donkey's shit-stirring influence is uncomparable.

                    Phew! I think I'm getting too sentimental. We've really come a long way since year 1 huh! It's almost as if 6 years flew by so quickly. Watching everyone grow up so quickly, part ways and walk different paths in life is so bitter-sweet.
                    If I could turn back time, I would have chosen to walk the very same path with all of you again.
                    <br><br>
                    RVHS may have been a bubble that insulated us from all the drama and wild gossips from other schools, and it may have left us ill-prepared for
                    the cruel outside world. But the way I see it, it was truly a blessing in disguise. Nowhere else will you find such pure and wholesome people who are genuinely
                    so kind and loving.

                    To the one that sat beside me in Year 4, the one where our friendship mysteriously fell through, and the one who made the effort to reconnect
                    after two years, thank you from the bottom of my heart. You were part of some of my happiest memories from RV. 
                    <br><br>
                    I was never able to confess to you back then. 
                    Was it my ego? My pride? My fear of rejection? Perhaps it was all of them. But today, I will proudly say, you were among the best people
                    I've ever met and I really really liked you a lot back then. It was such a shame things turned out the way it did.
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps if circumstances were different, if I was much more mature, if I wasn't so stupid and ignorant, we could still been friends, close friends even.
                    <br><br>
                    But I reap what I sow, and I have learnt to live with it.

                    cheers to the ones that are still here today, cheers to the ones that I lost on the way, you were all an integral part of who I am today.
                    Though we may not stay in contact anymore, I still think all of you, and I reminisce about all the great times we had.
